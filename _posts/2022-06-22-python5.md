Built-in classes can be used with Python operators.
However, the same operator responds differently to several types.
For instance, the + operator will combine two lists, concatenate two strings, or perform arithmetic addition on two numbers.


Operator overloading is a Python feature that enables the same operator to have several meanings depending on the context. 

So what happens when we use them with objects of a user-defined class? Let us consider the following class, which tries to simulate a point in 2-D coordinate system.

```python
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
    
    p1 = Point(1,2)
    p2 = Point(2,3)

    print(p1+p2)

    Output: 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<string>", line 9, in <module>
        print(p1+p2)
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
```
Here, we can see that a TypeError was thrown because Python was unable to combine two Point objects. However, using operator overloading in Python, we can complete this work. 

## Python Special Functions
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python. These functions are not the typical functions that we define for a class. The __init__() function we defined above is one of them. It gets called every time we create a new object of that class.

There are numerous other special functions in Python. 

Using special functions, we can make our class compatible with built-in functions.

```python
    p1 = Point(2,3)
    print(p1)

    Output:
    <__main__.Point object at 0x00000000031F8CC0>
```
Let's say that instead of printing what we got, we want the print() function to print the coordinates of the Point object. In our class, we may define a __str__() method that regulates how the item is printed.
Let's examine how we can accomplish this: 
```python
    class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x,self.y)
```
Trying the `print()` function again.
```python
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

        def __str__(self):
            return "({0}, {1})".format(self.x, self.y)


    p1 = Point(2, 3)
    print(p1)

    Output: (2,3)
```
Turns out, that this same method is invoked when we use the built-in function `str()` or `format()`.

```
    str(p1)
    Output: '(2,3)'

    format(p1)
    Output: '(2,3)'
```
So, when we use `str(p1)` or `format(p1)`, Python internally calls the p1.__str__() method. Hence the name, special functions.


## Overloading the `+` Operator
We must include the __add__() function in the class in order to overload the + operator. 
```python
    class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

    def __add__(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)


    p1 = Point(1,2)
    p2 = Point(2,3)

    print(p1+p2)

    Output: (3,5)
```
In the above program, what exactly happens is that when we use `p1+p2`, Python class `p1.__add__(p2)` which in turn is `Point.__add__(p1,p2)`. After this, the addition operation is carried out the way we specified. 

Similary, we can overload other operators as well. The special function that we need to implement is tabulated below.

| Operator | Expression | Internally |
| Addition | `p1 + p2` | `p1.__add__(p2)` |
| Subtraction | `p1 - p2` | `p1.__sub__(p2)` |
| Multiplication | `p1 * p2` | `p1.__mul__(p2)` |
| Power | `p1 ** p2` | `p1.__pow__(p2)` |
| Division | `p1 / p2` | `p1.__truediv__(p2)` |
| Floor Division | `p1 // p2` | `p1.__floordiv__(p2)` |
| Remainder(modulo) | `p1 %p 2` | `p1.__mod__(p2)` |
| Bitwise Left Shift | `p1 << p2` | `p1.__lshift__(p2)` |
| Bitwise Right Shift | `p1 >> p2` | `p1.__rshift__(p2)` |
| Bitwise AND | `p1 & p2` | `p1.__and__(p2)` |
| Bitwise OR | `p1 | p2` | `p1.__or__(p2)` |
| Bitwise XOR | `p1 ^ p2` | `p1.__xor__(p2)` |
| Bitwise NOT | `~p1` | `p1.__invert__(p2)` |


## Overloading Comparison Operators
Operator overloading is not restricted to arithmetic operators in Python. Additionally, we can overload comparison operators.

Suppose, we wanted to implement the `<` symbol to the Point class. To achieve this, let's compare the distances between these places and the origin and then output the result. 
```python
    # overloading the less than operator
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

        def __str__(self):
            return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

        def __lt__(self, other):
            self_mag = (self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)
            other_mag = (other.x ** 2) + (other.y ** 2)
            return self_mag < other_mag

    p1 = Point(1,1)
    p2 = Point(-2,-3)
    p3 = Point(1,-1)

    # use less than
    print(p1<p2)
    print(p2<p3)
    print(p1<p3)

    Output: 
    True
    False
    False
```
Similarly, the special functions that we need to implement, to overload other comparison operators are tabulated below.

| Operator | Expression | Internally |
| Less than | `p1 < p2` | p1.__lt__(p2) |
| Less than or equal to | `p1 <= p2` | p1.__le__(p2) |
| Equal to | `p1 == p2` | p1.__eq__(p2) |
| Not Equal to | `p1 != p2` | p1.__ne__(p2) |
| Greater than | `p1 > p2` | p1.__gt__(p2) |
| Greater than or equal to | `p1 >= p2` | p1.__ge__(p2) |
