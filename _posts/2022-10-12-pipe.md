Pipes are used to redirect a stream from one program to another program. The output of one command redirect it to the input of another. It allows us to combine multiple commands. 

## Pipe Syntax
We use `|` symbol to separate two commands. By using the `|` operator, the output of the first command is passed/redirected to the second command.
Syntax: command1 | command2

- ### To find the no of files present in a directory.
  ```
  Input: ls -1 | wc -l
  ```

- ### To combine both file content using cat and sort it
  Suppose we have two files:- namex.txt and country.txt
  ```
  #names
  Leonard
  Sheldon
  Raj
  Amy
  Howard
  Bernadette
  Penny
  Leonard
  ```
  #country
  Spain
    England
    Italy
    France
    Brazil
    Argentina
  ```
  
  Now, to combine both file content using cat and sort  it.
  
  ```
  Input: cat names.txt country.txt | sort > abc.txt
  Output: <br/>
  Amy
  Argentina
  Bernadette
  Brazil
  England
  France
  Howard
  Italy
  Leonard
  Leonard
  Penny
  Raj
  Sheldon
  Spain
  ```

- ### Find unique records from a file
    > To use the `uniq` command first the data must be in a sorted order. 
    {: .prompt-info}

    ```
    Input: cat namex.txt | sort | uniq
    Output: 
    Amy
    Bernadette
    Howard
    Leonard
    Penny
    Raj
    Sheldon
    ```

- ### How to see only range of lines in a file
    ```
    Input: cat fakenames.txt | head -5
    Output: 
    1,Gregory Mueller 
    2,Mark Jacobs 
    3,Amanda Cooper 
    4,Isaac Conrad 
    5,Ashley Berg      
    ```

    ```
    Input: cat fakenames.txt | head -10 | tail -5 
    Output: 
    6,Nicholas Clark 
    7,Jamie Wright 
    8,Kevin Landry 
    9,Stefanie Johnson 
    10,Annette Johnson    
    ```

- ### How to use `more` and `less` command
    We use these command when there is large amount of output/data to see in the terminal.
    - The `more` command displays the output/data from the start and then shows page by page afterwards.

    ```
    Input: ls -1 | more
    ```

    - The `less` command displays the output/data from the start and then shows in a file type.

    ```
    Input: ls -1 | less
    ```
    > we can also search by presing the `/` and the typing the search keyword.

- ### `tee` command in Linux
The `tee` command reads the standard input and copies it both to stdOutput and to a file. We can see the information going through pipeline.

![img](/assets/img/tee.png)

    ```
    Input: ls | tee files.txt
    ```


- ### `XARGS` command in Linux
The `xargs` command converts the standard input into command line arguement.

    ```
    Input: ls | xargs echo
    Output: country.txt fakenames.txt files.txt names.txt sorted_names_country.txt

    Input: ls | xargs echo "Hello"
    Output: Hello country.txt fakenames.txt files.txt names.txt sorted_names_country.txt
    ```

    Example:
    Suppose we have a file named "FileNames.txt"
    ```
    #FileNammes
    file1
    file2
    file3
    file4
    file5
    ```
    Now, suppose we want to take those names from 'FileNames.txt' and create a new file for each of those filenames.

    ```
    Input: cat FileNames.txt | xargs touch
    ```
    Here, the output of `cat FileNaes.txt` is converted into an command line argument using the xargs and passed it to the `touch` command using the `|` operator.
