# Object Oriented Programming
Python, a multi-paradigm programming language supports several coding techniques. Making objects is one of the common ways to tackle a programming language. This is known an Objected Oriented approach to programming.

In python, any object has two characteristics:
- attributes
- behavior
Example:
Suppose a car has the following properties:
- make, model, year, odometer_reading as attributes
- read_odometer, get_desriptive_name as methods

## Class
A class can be defined as the blueprint for an obect. We can think of class as a blueprint with labels. It contains all the details about the make, modle, year, odometer_reading, etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the car. Here, a car is an object.

The example for class of car can be:
```python
class Car:
    pass
```
Here, we define the empty class `Car`` using the class keyword.
We create instances from classes.
An instance is a particular object that was made from a certain class. 

## Object
An instantiation of a class results in an object (instance).
Only the object's description is defined when a class is created.
As a result, no storage or RAM is allocated.


An example of a car class object is: 
```python
obj = Car()
```
Here, `obj` is an object of a class `Car`.

Let's say we know specifics about cars.
We will now demonstrate how to create the `Car` class and its objects. 

### Example 1: Creating Class and Object in Python
```python
class Car;
    #class attribute
    type='electric'

    #instance attribute
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

#instantiate the Car class
car1 = Car('Audi', 'A4', 2016)
car2 = Car('Toyta', 'T1', 2017)

#access the class attributes
print(f'Car1 is of type: {car1.__class__.type}')
print(f'Car2 is of type: {car2.__class__.type}')

#access the instance attributes
print(f'{car1.make}'s model is {car1.model} and it was made in {car1.year}')
print(f'{car2.make}'s model is {car2.model} and it was made in {car2.year}')


Output:
Audi is of type: electric
Audi is of type: electric
Audi's model is A4 and it was made in 2016
Toyota's model is T1 and it was made in 2017
```
In the above program, we created a class with the name `Car`. Then we defined the class attribute `type` and the instance attributes `make`, `model` and `year`. The class attribute is defined outside the `__init__` method and the instance attributes are defined within the `__init__` method of the class. The `__init__` method is the one that is called first whenever the object is first created. 

We then create two instances `car1` and `car2` of the `Car` class. 

We can access the class attribute using `__class__.species`. Class attributes are the same for all instances of a class. Similarly, we use car1.make, car1.model and car1.year to access the instance characteristics. But each instance of a class has a unique set of instance characteristics.  


## Methods
Methods are simple the functions that are defined within the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object. 

### Example2: Creating Methods in Python
```python
class Car():

    #instance attributes
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0

    #instance methods
    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name


#instantiate the object
my_new_car = Car('Audi', 'A4', 2016)

#calling our instance methods
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

Output: Audi A4 2016
```

## Inheritance
By leveraging the details of an existing class without changing it, a new class can be created through inheritance. A derived class has just been created (or child class).The current class is a base class in a similar way (or parent class). 

### Example 3: Use of inheritance in Python
```python
class Car():
    def __init__(self, make, model,year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0


    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = str(self.year) + " " + self.make + " " + self.model
        return long_name.title()


    def read_odometer(self):
        print("This car has run {} miles on it".format(str(self.odometer_reading)))


    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        if mileage < self.odometer_reading:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer")
        else:
            self.odometer_reading = mileage

    def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        self.odometer_reading += miles


    def fill_gas_tank(self):
        """Electric cars don't have gas tanks."""
        print("This car doesn't need a gas refill!")



class Battery():
    def __init__(self, battery_size = 70):
        self.battery_size = battery_size


    def describe_battery(self):
        print("This car has a {} -kwh batteyr.".format(self.battery_size))


    def get_range(self):
        if self.battery_size == 70:
            range = 240
        elif self.battery_size == 85:
            range = 270
        message = "This car can go approximately " + str(range)
        message += " miles on a full charge."
        print(message)


    def upgrade_battery(self):
        if self.battery_size != 85:
            self.battery_size = 85



class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self,make,model,year):
        super().__init__(make,model,year)
        self.battery = Battery()


    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        
        long_name = "This is an electric car " + str(self.year) + " " + self.make + " " + self.model
        return long_name.title()


    def fill_gas_tank(self):
        print("This car doesn't need a gas tank!")


    def is_this_electric(self):
        print('Yes, this is electric')


my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2016)
my_tesla.read_odometer()
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
my_tesla.fill_gas_tank()


Output:
This car has run 0 miles on it.
This Is An Electric Car 2016 Tesla Model S
This car doesn't need a gas tank!
Yes, this is electric.
```

In the above program, we created three classes i.e `Car` (parent class), `Battery`, and `ElectricCar` (child class). The child class inherits the functions of the parent class. We can see this from the `read_odometer()` method.

Again, the child class modifies the behavior  of the parent class. We can see this from them `get_descriptive_name()` method. Furthermore, we extedn the functions of the parent class by creating  a new `is_this_electric()` method.

In the `__init__()` method of the child class, we also employ the `super()` function. This enables us to call the parent class's `__init__()` method form the child class.


## Encapsulation
We can limit access to methods and variables in Python by using OOP. Encapsulation is the process of preventing direct data change. In Python, we use the underscore prefix to indicateprivate attributes, such as single `_` or double `__` underscores.

### Example 4: Data Encapsulation In Python
```python
class IceCream:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__maxprice = 200

    def sell(self):
        print(f'Selling Price: {self.__maxprice}')

    def setmaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price


icecream = IceCream()
icecream.sell()

# change the price
icecream.__maxprice = 250
icecream.sell()

# using setter function
icecream.setmaxPrice(250)
icecream.sell()

Output:
Selling Price: 200
Selling Price: 200
Selling Price: 250
```
In the above program, we defined an `IceCream` class. We used `__init__()` method to store the maximum selling price of `IceCream`. 

```python
icecream.__maxprice = 250
```
Here, we have tried to modify the value of `__maxprice` outside of the class. However, since `__maxprice` is a private variable, this modification is not seen on output. As practiced aboce, we have to change the value of `__maxprice` using a setter function like `setmaxPrice()` which takes `price` as its parameter. 

## Polymorphism
In Object Oriented Programming, the ability to use a common interface for many forms is known as polymorphism (data types). Consider that there are various shape alternatives when we need to color a form (rectangle, square, circle). However, we could color any form using the same technique. This concept is known as Polymorphism

### Example 5: Using Polymorphism in Python
```python
class Car():
    def __init__(self, make, model,year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0


    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = str(self.year) + " " + self.make + " " + self.model
        print(long_name.title())

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self,make,model,year):
        super().__init__(make,model,year)


    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = "This is an electric car " + str(self.year) + " " + self.make + " " + self.model
        print(long_name.title())


#common interface
def get_description(obj):
    obj.get_descriptive_name()

#instantiate objects
car1 = Car('Audi', 'A1', 2016)
car2 = ElectricCar('Tesla', 'T1', 2020)

#passing the object
get_description(car1)
get_description(car2)

Output:
2016 Audi A1
This Is An Electric Car 2020 Tesla T1
```
In the above program, we defined two classes:- `Car` and `ElectricCar`. The `get_descriptive_name()` method is share by all of them. However, each Car shares a different version of the function.

Now, to use `Polymorphism`, we develop a common interface called `get_description()`, which accepts any object and calls the objects `get_descriptive_name()` method. As a result, the `get_description()` method successfully executed when supplied it the `car1` and `car2` objects.
