- ## Assigning Variables
    Similar to other languages, you can assign variables with the equal notation.
    ```
    var1='Moon;
    ```
    Then reference with `$` notation.
    ```
    echo $var
    ```
    ```
    Result: 
    Moon
    ```


- ## Assigning String Variables
    Name your variable as you like (something sensible!):
    ```
        firstname='Cynthia'
        lastname='Liu'
        echo 'Hi there' $firstname $lastname
    ```

    ```
    Result:
    Hi there Cynthia Liu
    ```
    

- ## Missing the $ notation
    If you miss the `$` notation - it isn't a variable
    ```
    firstname='Cynthia'
    lastname='Liu'
    echo 'Hi there ' firstname lastname
    ```
    ```
    Result:
    Hi there firstname lastname
    ```


- ## (Not) assigning variables
    Bash is not very forgiving about spaces in variable creation. Beware of adding spaces!
    ```
    var1 = "Moon"
    echo $var1
    ```
    > script.sh: line 3: var1: command not found
    {: .prompt-danger}

    > Don't add spaces before and after the `=` sign.


- ## Single, double, backticks
    In Bash, using different quotation marks can mean different things. Both when creating variables and printing. 
    - Single quotes (`'sometext'`)=Shell interprets what is between literally
    - Double quotes (`"sometext"`)=Shell interprets literally **except** using `$` and backticks
    The last way creates a 'shell-within-a-shell', outlined below. Useful for calling command-line programs. This is done with backticks.
    - Backticks(``) = Shell runs the command and captures STDOUT back into a variable.


- ## Different variable creation
    Let's see the effect of different types of variable creation
    ```
    now_var='NOW'
    now_var_singlequote='$now_var'
    echo $now_var_singlequote
    ```
    >Returns: $now_var
    ```
    now_var_doublequote="$now_var"
    echo $now_var_doublequote
    ```
    >Returns: NOW


- ## The date program
    The `Date` program will be useful for demonstrating backticks
    Normal output of this program:
    ```
    date
    ```
    > Mon 2 Dec 2019 14:07:10 AEDT


- ## Shell within a shell
    Let's use the shell-within-a-shell now:
    ```
    rightnow_doublequote="The date is `date`."
    echo $rightnow_doublequote
    ```
    > Returns: The date is Mon 2 Dec 2019 14:13:35 AEDT.

    The date program was called, output captured and combined in-line with the `echo` call.
    We used a shell within a shell


- ## Parentheses vs backticks
    There is an equivalent to backtick notation:
    ```
    rightnow_doublequotes="The date is `date`."
    rightnow_parentheses="The date is $(date)."
    echo $rightnow_doublequotes
    echo $rightnow_parentheses
    ```
    ```
    Returns:
    The date is Mon 2 Dec 2019 14:54:34 AEDT.
    The date is Mon 2 Dec 2019 14:54:34 AEDT.
    ```
    > Both work the same though using blackticks is older. Parentheses is used more in modern applications.

# Numeric variables in Bash
- ## Numbers in other languages
    Numbers are not built in natively to the shell like most REPLs (console) such as R and Python

    In Python or R you may do:
    ```
    >>> 1 + 4
    ```
    > Returns: 5

- ## Numbers in the shell
    Numbers are nto natively supported:
    (In the terminal)
    ```
    1 + 4
    ```
    > bash: 1: command not found


- ## Introducing expr
    `expr` is a useful utility program (just like `cat` or `grep`)
    This will now work (in the terminal):
    ```
    expr 1 + 4
    ```
    > Returns: 5


- ## expr limitations
    `expr` cannot natively handle decimal places;
    (In terminal)
    ```
    expr 1 + 2.5
    ```
    > expr: not a decimal number: '2.5'
    We can get past this limiation using `bc`


- ## Getting numbers to bc
    Using `bc` without opening the calculator is possible by piping:
    ```
    echo "5 + 7.5" | bc
    ```
    > 12.5


- ## bc scale argument
    `bc` also has a `scale` argument for how many decimal places.
    ```
    echo "10/3" | bc
    ```
    > 3
    ```
    echo "scale=3; 10/3" | bc
    ```
    Note the use of `;` to separate 'lines' in terminal
    > 3.333


- ## Numbers in Bash Scripts
    We can assign numeric variables just like string variables:
    ```
    dog_name='Roger'
    dog_age=6
    echo "My dog's name is $dog_name and he is $dog_age years old"
    ```
    Beware that `dog_age="6"` will work, but makes it a string!
    > My dog's name is Roger and he is 6 years old


- ## Double bracket notation
    A variant on single bracket variable notation for numeric variables:
    ```
    expr 5 + 7
    echo $((5+7))
    ```
    > Returns:<br/> 12 <br/> 12

    Beawre this method uses `expr`, not `bc`


- ## Shell within a shell revisited
    Very useful for numeric variables:
    ```
    model1=87.65
    model2=89.20
    echo "The total score is $(echo "$model1 + $modle2" | bc)"
    echo "The average score is $(echo "($model1 + $modle2) / 2" | bc)"
    ```
    >Returns <br/> The total score is 176.85 <br/> The average score is 88

# Arrays in Bash
- ## What is an array?
    Two types of arrays in Bash:
    - An array
        - 'Normal' numerical-indexed structure.
        - Called a 'list' in Python or 'vector' in R.
        In Python: `my_list=[1,3,2,4]
        In R: `my_vector <- c(1,3,2,4)`
