> In a database, a **view** is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. 

**Virtual table that is not part of the physical schema**
- Query, not data, is stored in memory
- Data is aggregated from data in tables
- Can be queried like a regular database table
- No need to  retype  common queries or alter schemas


- ## Creating A View
    > Syntax: 

    ```sql
        CREATE VIEW view_name AS

        SELECT col1, col2
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;
    ```

    Example:
    ```sql
        CREATE VIEW scifi_books AS
        SELECT
            title, 
            author,
            genre
        FROM dim_book_sf
        JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_genre_sf.genre_id = dim_book_sf.genre_id
        JOIN dim_author_sf ON dim_author_sf.author_id = dim_book_sf.author_id
        WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'science fiction';
    ```

- ## Querying a view (example)
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM scifi_books
    ```


- ## Viewing Views
    >
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM information_schema.views;
    ```
    > Includes system views
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM information_schema.views
        WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');
    ```
    > Excludes system views


- ## Benefits of Views
    - Doesn't take up storage
    - A form of **access control**
        - Hide sensitive columns and restrict what user can see
    - Masks complexity of queries
        - Useful for highly normalized schemas

# Managing Views
- ## Creating more complex views
    - **Aggregation**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `GROUP BY`, etc.
    - **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`
    - **Conditionals**: `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `AND`, `OR`, `>`, `<`, etc.


- ## Granting and revoking access to a view
    `GRANT privilege(s) or REVOKE privilege(s)` <br/>
    `ON object` <br/>
    `TO role` or `FROM role`

    - **Privileges**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.
    - **Objects**: table, view, schema, etc.
    - **Roles**: a database user or a group of database users


- ## Granting and Revoking Example
    ```sql
        GRANT UPDATE ON ratings TO PUBLIC;
    ```

    ```sql
        REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM db_user;
    ```

- ## Updating a view
    ```sql
        UPDATE films SET kind='Dramatic' WHERE  kind='Drama';
    ```
    **Not all views are updatable**
    - View is made up of one table
    - Doesn't use a window or aggregate function


- ## Inserting into a view
    ```sql
        INSERT INTO films (code, title, did, date_prod, kind)
            VALUES('T_601', 'Yojimbo', 106, '1961-06-16', 'Drama');
    ```
    **Not all views are insertable**

    {: .prompt-danger}


- ## Dropping a view
    ```sql
        DROP VIEW view_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];
    ```
    - `RESTRICT` (default): returns an error if there are objects that depend on the view
    - `CASCADE`: drops view and any object that depends on that view


- ## Redefining a view
    ```sql
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS new_query
    ```
    - If a view with `view_name` exists, it is replaced
    - `new_query` must generate the same column names, order, and data types as the old query
    - The column output may be different
    - New columns may be added at the end
    > If these criteria can't be met, drop the existing view and create a new one


- ## Altering a view
    ```sql
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name ALTER [ COLUMN ] column_name SET DEFAULT expression
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name ALTER [ COLUMN ] column_name DROP DEFAULT 
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name OWNER TO new_owner
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name RENAME TO new_name
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name SET SCHEMA new_schema
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name SET ( view_option_name [=view_option_value] [,...])
        ALTER VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name RESET (view_option_name [,...])
    ```

# Materialized Views
- ## Two Types of Views
    - Views
        - Also known as **non-materialized views**
    - Materialized Views
        - Physically Materialized
        - Stores the **query results**, not the **query**
        - Querying a materialized view  means accessing the stored query results
            - Not running the query like a non-materialized view
        - Refreshed or rematerialized when prompted or scheduled


- ## When to use materialized views
    - Long running queries
    - Underlying query results don't change often
    - Data warehouses because OLAP is not write-intensive
        - Save on computational cost of frequent queries


- ## Implementing materialized views
    ```sql
        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mv AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;

        REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mv;
    ```

- ## Managing dependencies
    - Materialized views often depend on other materialized views
    - Creates a **dependency chain** when refreshing views
    - Not the most efficient to refresh all views at the same time


- ## Tools for Managing Dependencies
    - Use **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** to keep track of views
    - Pipeline scheduler tools like:- **Apache Airflow, Luigi**
