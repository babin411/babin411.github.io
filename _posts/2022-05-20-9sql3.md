- ## Advantages of Triggers
    - Used for database integrity
    - Enforece business rules directly in the database
    - Control on which statements are allowed in a database
    - Implementatino of complex business logic triggered by a single event
    - Simple way to audit databases and user actions

- ## Disadvantages of Triggers
    - Difficult to view and detect
    - Invisible to client applications or when debugging code
    - Hard to follow their logic when troubleshooting
    - Can become an overhead on the server and make it run slower


- ## Finding server-level triggers
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.server_triggers;
    ```

- ## Finding database and table triggeers
    ```sql
        SELECT * From sys.triggers;
    ```

- ## Viewing a trigger definition (option 1)
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventOrdersUpdate
        ON Orders
        INSTEAD OF UPDATE
        AS
        RAISERROR ('Updates on "Orders" table
                    are not permitted.
                    Place a new order
                    to add new products.', 16, 1);
    ```

- ## Viewing a trigger definition (option 2)
    ```sql
        SELECT definition
        FROM sys.sql_modules
        WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID ('PreventOrdersUpdate');
    ```
- ## Viewing a trigger definition (option 3)
    ```sql
        SELECT OBJECT_DEFINITION (OBJECT_ID ('PreventOrdersUpdate'));
    ```
- ## Viewing a trigger definition (option 4)
    ```sql
        EXECUTE sp_helptext @objanem = 'PreventOrderUpdate';
    ```

# Use Cases For After Triggers (DML)
- ## Keeping a history of row changes
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER CopyCustomersToHistory
        ON Customers
        AFTER INSERT, UPDATE
        AS
            INSERT INTO CustomersHistory (Customer, ContractId, Address, PhoneNo)
            SELECT Customer, ContractID, Address, PhoneNo, GETDATE()
            FROM inserted;
    ```

- ## Table auditing using triggers
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER OrdersAudit
        ON Orders
        AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        AS
            DECLARE @Insert BIT = 0 , @Delete BIT = 0;
            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) SET @Insert = 1;
            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) SET @Delete = 1;
            INSERT INTO [TablesAudit] ([TableName], [EventType], [UserAccount], [EventDate])
            SELECT 'Orders' AS [TableName]
                ,CASE WHEN @Insert = 1 AND @Delete = 0 THEN 'INSERT'
                WHEN @Insert = 1 AND @Delete = 1 THEN 'UPDATE'
                WHEN @Insert = 0 AND @Delete = 1 THEN 'DELETE'
                END AS [Event]
                ,ORIGINAL_LOGIN()
                ,GETDATE();
    ```

- ## Notifying Users
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER NewOrderNotification
        ON Orders
        AFTER INSERT
        AS
            EXECUTE SendNotification @RecipientEmail = 'sales@freshfruit.com',
            @EmailSubject = "New order place",
            @EmailBody = 'A new order was just placed.';
    ```

# Use cases for INSTEAD OF triggers (DML)
- ## General use of INSTEAD OF triggers
    - Prevent operations from happening
    - Control database statements
    - Enforce data integrity


- ## Triggers that prevent changes
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventProductChanges
        ON Products
        INSTEAD OF UPDATE
        AS 
            RAISERROR ('Updates of products are not permitted. Contact the database administrator if a change is needed.', 16, 1);
    ```

- ## Triggers that prevent and notify
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventCustomersRemoval
        ON Customers
        INSTEAD OF DELETE
        AS
            DECLARE @EmailBodyText NVARCHAR(50) =
                            (SELECT 'User "' + ORIGINAL_LOGIN() +
                            '" tried to remove a customer from the database.');
            RAISERROR ('Customer entries are not subject to removal.', 16, 1);
            
            EXECUTE SendNotification @RecipientEmail = 'admin@freshfruit.com'
                            ,@EmailSubject = 'Suspicious database behavior'
                            ,@EmailBody = @EmailBodyText;
        ```


- ## Triggers with Conditional Logic
    ```sql
            CREATE TRIGGER ConfirmStock
            ON Orders
            INSTEAD OF INSERT
            AS
                IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Products AS p
                        INNER JOIN inserted AS i ON i.Product = p.Product
                        WHERE p.Quantity < i.Quantity)
                    RAISERROR ('You cannot place orders when there is no product stock.', 16, 1);
                ELSE
                    INSERT INTO dbo.Orders (Customer, Product, Quantity, OrderDate, TotalAmount)
                    SELECT Customer, Product, Quantity, OrderDate, TotalAmount FROM inserted;
    ```

- ## Database Auditing
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER DatabaseAudit
        ON DATABASE
        FOR DDL_TABLE_VIEW_EVENTS
        AS
            INSERT INTO [DatabaseAudit] ([EventType], [Database], [Object],
            [UserAccount], [Query], [EventTime])
            SELECT
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/EventType)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(50)'),
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/DatabaseName)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(50)'),
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/ObjectName)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(100)'),
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/LoginName)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(100)'),
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/TSQLCommand/CommandText)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)'),
            EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/PostTime)[1]', 'DATETIME');
    ```

- ## Preventing Server Changes
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventDatabaseDelete
        ON ALL SERVER
        FOR DROP_DATABASE
        AS
            PRINT 'You are not allowed to remove existing databases.';
            ROLLBACK;
    ```
