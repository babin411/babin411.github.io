A SQL Server is a relational database system developed by Microsoft. And a Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a Microsoft's implemenataion of SQL butwith added functionality. 

# Queries
- ## `SELECT`
    > Is used for retreiving data from the table. 
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example: 
         - ```sql
            SELECT description 
            FROM grid;
            ```
        - #### Selecting more than one column
            ```sql
            SELECT artist_id, artist_name
            FROM artist;
            ```
        - #### SELECT TOP()
            > Return top 5 rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT TOP(5) artist
            FROM artists;
            ```
        - #### SELECT TOP() PERCENT
            ```sql
            > Return top 5% of rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            SELECT TOP(5) PERCENT artist
            FROM artists;
            ```
        - #### SELECT DISTINCT
            > Returns unique rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT DISTINCT nerc_region
            FROM grid;
            ```
        - #### SELECT *
            > Returns all rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT *
            FROM grid;
            ```
            >`NOT` suitable for large tables
            {: .prompt-warning}
            

- ## `AS`
    > Aliasing column names

        - ```sql
            SELECT description AS cause_of_courage
            FROM grid;
            ```

- ## `ORDER BY`
    > Use ORDER BY is order is important.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT TOP(10) product_id, year_intro
            FROM products
            ORDER BY year_intro, product_id;
            ```
            > In the above example, first it is ordered by `year_intro` and then it is order by `product_id`
            {: .prompt-info}

        - ```sql
            SELECT TOP(10) product_id, year_intro

            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total <>> 10;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement returns records where `total` is not equal to 10.

                release_year = 1994
                AND artist = 'Green Day'
                AND song = 'Basket Case';

            ```
            > Returns those records where the value of total is in between the range of 20-30 inclusive. 
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

            WHERE billing_state IS NOT NULL;

            ```
            > Returns the total of all the `affected_customers`
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                SUM(affected_customers) AS total_affected,
                SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS total_loss
            FROM grid;
            ```
            > Returns the total of all the `affected_customers` amd `demand_loss_mw` columns.

            FROM grid
            WHERE affected_customers > 0;
            ```
            > It returns the minimum value of the `affected_customer` column from all the records where `affected_customer` > 0.

            FROM grid;
            ```

- ## `CHARINDEX`
    > The CHARINDEX() function searches for a substring in a string, and returns the position. If the substring is not found, this function returns 0.  
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT
                CHARINDEX('-', url) AS char_location,
                url
            FROM courses;
            ```

- ## `SUBSTRING`
    >  It returns the part of the string from the specified starting location to the specified end location.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    > Syntax: REPLACE(string, start, end)
    {: .prompt-info}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT
                SUBSTRING(url, 12, 12) AS target_section,
                url
            FROM courses;
            ```

- ## `REPLACE`
    > IT replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring.
    {: .prompt-tip}

    {: .prompt-info}
    - ### Example:

                TOP(5) REPLACE(url, '_','-') AS replace_with_hyphen
            FROM grid;
            ```

- ## `GROUP BY`
    > The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country". The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example: 
        - ```sql
            SELECT
                SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS lost_demand,
                description
            FROM grid
            GROUP BY description;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement groups the records by description and for each group calculates the sum of `demand_loss_mw`.
            {: .prompt-info}

        - ```sql
            SELECT
                SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS lost_demand,
                description
            FROM grid
            WHERE 
                description LIKE '%storm'
                AND demand_loss_mw IS NOT NULL
            GROUP BY description;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement groups the records by description and filters the records with the conditions specified in WHERE clause and then aggregates using the SUM function from the result queires.
            {: .prompt-info}


- ## `HAVING`
    > The `HAVING` clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. It can be used when filtering with groups.
    - ### Example: 
        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS lost_demand,
                description
            FROM grid
            WHERE
                description LIKE '%storm'
                AND demand_loss_mw IS  NOT NULL
            GROUP BY description
            HAVING SUM(demand_loss_mw) > 1000;
        > The above SQL statement groups the records by description and filters the records with the conditions specified in WHERE clause and then aggregates using the SUM function from the result queires. Then the results after applying aggregating functions are filterd using the conditions specified in the `Having` clause.
