A SQL Server is a relational database system developed by Microsoft. And a Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a Microsoft's implemenataion of SQL butwith added functionality. 

# Queries
- ## `SELECT`
    > Is used for retreiving data from the table. 
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example: 
         - ```sql
            SELECT description 
            FROM grid;
            ```
        - #### Selecting more than one column
            ```sql
            SELECT artist_id, artist_name
            FROM artist;
            ```
        - #### SELECT TOP()
            > Return top 5 rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT TOP(5) artist
            FROM artists;
            ```
        - #### SELECT TOP() PERCENT
            ```sql
            > Return top 5% of rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            SELECT TOP(5) PERCENT artist
            FROM artists;
            ```
        - #### SELECT DISTINCT
            > Returns unique rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT DISTINCT nerc_region
            FROM grid;
            ```
        - #### SELECT *
            > Returns all rows
            {: .prompt-tip }
            ```sql
            SELECT *
            FROM grid;
            ```
            >`NOT` suitable for large tables
            {: .prompt-warning}
            

- ## `AS`
    > Aliasing column names 
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT demand_loss_mw AS lost_demand
            FROM grid;
            ```
        - ```sql
            SELECT description AS cause_of_courage
            FROM grid;
            ```

- ## `ORDER BY`
    > Use ORDER BY is order is important.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT TOP(10) product_id, year_intro
            FROM products
            ORDER BY year_intro, product_id;
            ```
            > In the above example, first it is ordered by `year_intro` and then it is order by `product_id`
            {: .prompt-info}

        - ```sql
            SELECT TOP(10) product_id, year_intro
            FROM products
            ORDER BY year_intro DESC, product_id;
            ```
            > In the above example, firs it is order by `year_intro` in the descending orderand then by `product_id`
            {: .prompt-info}

- ## `WHERE`
    > Use `Where` to return rows that meet certain criteria.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total > 15;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement returns records where `total` is greater than 15.
            {: .prompt-tip}
        
        - ```sql
            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total <>> 10;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement returns records where `total` is not equal to 10.
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT *
            FROM songlist
            WHERE
                release_year = 1994
                AND artist = 'Green Day'
                AND song = 'Basket Case';
            ```
            > The above SQL statement returns records where all the given conditions are satisfied.
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                song,
                artist,
                release_year
            FROM songlist
            WHERE
                release_year = 1994
                OR release_year >2000;
            ```
            > The above SQL statement returns records where at least one of the given condition is satisfied.
            {: .prompt-tip}


- ## `BETWEEN`
    > Use `Between` to return where the values lies between the specified range.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example: 
        - ```sql
            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
            ```
            > Returns those records where the value of total is in between the range of 20-30 inclusive. 
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT customer_id, total
            FROM invoice
            WHERE total NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
            ```
            > Returns those records where the value of total is not in between the range of 20-30 inclusive. 
            {: .prompt-tip}

- ## `NULL`
    - It indicates that there is no value for that record
    - It helps to highlight gaps in our data.
    - ### Example: 
        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                TOP(6) total,
                billing_state
            FROM invoice
            WHERE billing_state IS NULL;
            ```
            > It returns records where billing_state is NULL.
            {: .prompt-tip}
        
        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                TOP(6) total,
                billing_state
            FROM invoice
            WHERE billing_state IS NOT NULL;
            ```
            > It returns records where billing_state is NOT NULL.
            {: .prompt-tip}

- ## `IN` 
    > It is used to return records where the values are inside the list followed by the `IN` keyword.
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT song, release_year
            FROM songlist
            WHERE
                release_year IN (1985, 1991, 1992);
            ```
            > Returns records where release_year is either of the list followed by the IN keyword.
            {: .prompt-tip}


- ## `LIKE`
    > It is used to return records where the values match the pattern specified after the `LIKE` keyword
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT artist
            FROM songlist
            WHERE artist LIKE 'f%';
            ```
            > Returns those records where values of artist column begins with an `f`.
            {: .prompt-tip}


- ## `SUM`
    > It is used to calculate the total amount of a column.
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - ### Example:
        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                SUM(affected_customers) AS total_affected
            FROM grid;
            ```
            > Returns the total of all the `affected_customers`
            {: .prompt-tip}

        - ```sql
            SELECT 
                SUM(affected_customers) AS total_affected,
                SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS total_loss
            FROM grid;
            ```
            > Returns the total of all the `affected_customers` amd `demand_loss_mw` columns.
            {: .prompt-tip}
