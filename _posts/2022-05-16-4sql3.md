- ## Key Aggregation Functions
    - Counts
        - `COUNT()`
        - `COUNT_BIG()`
        - `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
    - Other Aggregates
        - `SUM()`
        - `MIN()`
        - `MAX()`


- ## WHat counts with COUNT()
    - Number of Rows
        - `COUNT(*)`
        - `COUNT(1)`
        - `COUNT(1/0)`
    - Non-NULL Values
        - `COUNT(d.YR)`
        - `COUNT(NULLIF(d.YR, 1990))`


- ## Distinct Counts
    ```sql
        SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT c.CalendarYear) AS Years,
            COUNT(DISTINCT NULLIF(c.CalendarYear, 2010)) AS Y2
        FROM dbo.Calendar c;
    ```

- ## Filtering aggregates with CASE
    ```sql
        SELECT
            MAX(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeId = 1
                    THEN ir.IncidentDate
                    ELSE NULL
                END) AS I1,
            MAX(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeID = 2
                    THEN ir.IncidentDate
                    ELSE NULL
                END) AS I2,
        FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir; 
    ```

- ## Statistical Aggregate Functions
    - `AVG()` : Mean
    - `STDEV()`: Standard Deviation
    - `STDEVP()`: Population Stadard Deviation
    - `VAR()`: Variance
    - `VARP()`: Population Variance


- ## What about median?
    ```sql
        SELECT
            TOP(1) PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)
                WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY l.SomeVal DESC)
                OVER () AS MedianIncidents
        FROM dbo.LargeTable l;
    ```


- ## The cost of median

    |        | Median | Mean | 
    |:-------|:--------------|:-----------------|
    | Est. Cost | 95.7% | 4.3% |
    | Duration | 68.5s | 0.37s |
    | CPU | 68.5s | 8.1s |
    | Reads | 72,560,946 | 39,468 |
    | Writes | 87,982 | 0 |

# Downsampling and Upsampling Data

- ## Data in nature
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            SomeDate
        FROM dbo.SomeTable
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/somedate.png)

- ## Downsampling Data
    ```sql
        SELECT
            CAST(SomeDate AS DATE) AS SomeDate
        FROM dbo.SomeTable
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/downsample.png)


- ## Further Downsampling
    ```sql
        SELECT
            DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR,0,SomeDate), 0) AS SomeDate
        FROM dbo.SomeTable
    ```
    > `DATEDIFF(HOUR,0,'2019-08-11 06:21:16') = 1,048,470` <br>
    `DATEADD(HOUR< 1048748,0) = 2019-08-11 06:00:00`
    
    ![image](/assets/img/downsample2.png)


- ## What about upsampling?

    | Downsampling | Upsampling | 
    |:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
    | Aggregate data | Disaggregate data |
    | Can usually sum or coutn results | Need an allocation rule |
    | Provides a higher-level picture of  the data | Provides artifical granularity |
    | Acceptable for most purposes | Acceptable for data generation, calculated averages |

# Grouping by ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS

- ## Hierarchial rollups with ROLLUP
    ```sql
        SELECT
            t.Month,
            t.Day,
            SUM(t.Events) AS Events
        FROM TABLE
        GROUP BY
            t.Month,
            t.Day
        WITH ROLLUP
        ORDER BY
            t.Month,
            t.Day;
    ```

- ## Cartesian aggregation with CUBE
    ```sql
        SELECT
            t.IncidentType,
            t.Office,
            SUM(t.Events) AS Events
        FROM TABLE
        GROUP BY
            t.IncidentType,
            t.Office
        WITH ROLLUP
        ORDER BY
            t.IncidentType,
            t.Office;
    ```


- ## Define grouping sets with GROUPING SETS
    ```sql
        SELECT
            t.IncidenType,
            t.Office,
            SUM(t.Events) AS Events
        FROM TABLE
        GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
        (
            (t.IncidentType, t.Office),
            ()
        )
        ORDER BY
            t.IncidentType,
            t.Office;
    ```
