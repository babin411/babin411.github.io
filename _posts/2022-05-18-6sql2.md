# Star and Snowflake Schema
- ## Star Schema
    **Dimensional modeling: star schema**
    **Fact tables**
    - Holds records of a metric
    - Changes regularly
    - Connects to dimensions via foreign keys
    - Example: 
        - Supply books to stores in USA and Canada
        - Keep track of book sales

    **Dimension Tables**
    - Holds descriptions of attributes
    - Does not change as often


- ## Star Schema Example
    - One dimension

- ## Snowflake Schema (an extension)
    - More than one dimension because dimension tables are **normalized**

- ## What is Normalization?
    - Database design technique
    - Divides tables into smalller tables and connects them via relationships
    - **Goal** reduce redundancy and increase data integrity

    
- ## Book dimension of the star schema

    Most likely to have repeating values:
    - Author
    - Publisher
    - Genre

# Normalized and Denormalized Databases
- ## Back to our book store example

- ## Denormalized Query
    > **Goal**: get quantity of all Octavia E.Butler books sold in Vancouver in Q4 of 2018
    ```sql
        SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM fact_booksales
            -- Join to get city
            INNER JOIN dim_store_star on fact_booksales.store_id = dim_store_star.store_id
            -- Join to get author
            INNER JOIN dim_book_star on fact_booksales.book_id = dim_book_star.book_id
            -- Join to get year and quarter
            INNER JOIN dim_time_star on fact_booksales.time_id = dim_time_star.time_id
        WHERE
       dim_store_star.city = 'Vancouver' AND dim_book_star.author = 'Octavia E. Butler' AND dim_time_star.year = 2018 AND dim_time_star.quarter = 4;     
    ```

- ## Normalized Query
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SUM(fact_booksales.quantity)
        FROM fact_booksales
        -- Join to get city
        INNER JOIN dim_store_sf ON fact_booksales.store_id = dim_store_sf.store_id
        INNER JOIN dim_city ON dim_store_sf.city_id = dim_city_sf.city_id
        -- Join to get author
        INNER JOIN dim_book_sf ON fact_booksales.book_id = dim_book_sf.book_id
        INNER JOIN dim_author_sf ON dim_book_sf.author_id = dim_author_sf.author_id
        -- Join to get year and quarter
        INNER JOIN dim_time_sf ON fact_booksales.time_id = dim_time_sf.time_id
        INNER JOIN dim_month_sf ON dim_time_sf.month_id = dim_month_sf.month_id
        INNER JOIN dim_quarter_sf ON dim_month_sf.quarter_id = dim_quarter_sf.quarter_id
        INNER JOIN dim_year_sf ON dim_quarter_sf.year_id = dim_year_sf.year_id
    WHERE
        dim_city_sf.city = 'Vancouver'
        AND
        dim_author_sf.author = 'Octavia E.Butler'
        AND
        dim_year_sf.year = 2018 AND dim_quarter_sf.quarter = 4;
    ```

- ## Why Normalization?
    - Normalization saves space as it eliminates **data redundancy**
    - Normalization ensures better data integrity
        1. **Enforces data consistency**: Must respect naming conventions because of referential integrity, e.g:- 'California', not 'CA' or 'california'
        2. **Safer updating, removing, and inserting**: Less data redundancy = less records to alter
        3. **Easier to redesign by extending**: Smaller tables are easier to extend than larger tables

- ## Disadvantage of Normalization
    - Complex queries require more CPU


<hr/>

# Normal Forms
- ## Normalization
    > Idenfity repeating groups of data and create new tables for them<br/>
    A more formal definition:<br/>
    > The goals of normalization are to:
    - Be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a relational schema
    - Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy

    Ordered from least to most normalized:
    - First Normal Form (1NF)               
    - Second Normal Form (2NF)              
    - Third Normal Form (3NF)               
    - Elementary Key Normal Form (EKNF)
    - Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
    - Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
    - Essential Tuple Normal Form (ETNF)
    - Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
    - Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF)
    - Sixth Normal Form (6NF)


- ## 1NF Rules
    - Each record must be unique - no duplicate rows
    - Each cell must hold one value


- ## 2NF
    - Must satisfy 1NF AND
        - If primary key is one column
            - then automatically satisfies 2NF
        - If there is a composite primary key
            - then each non-key column must be dependent on all the keys


- ## 3NF
    - Satisifes 2NF
    - No **transitive dependencies**: non-key columns can't depend on other non-key columns


- ## Data Anomalies
    > What is risked if we don't normalize enough?
    1. Update anomaly
    2. Insertion anomaly
    3. Deletion anomaly

    > The more normalized the database, the less prone it will be to data anomalies
    {: .prompt-tip}


- ## Update Anomaly
    > Data inconsistency caused by data redundancy when updating

    ![image](/assets/img/update_anomaly.png)

    To update student `520`s email:
    - Need to update more than one record, otherwise, there will be inconsistency
    - User updating needs to know about redundancy


- ## Insertion Anomaly
    > Unable toadd a record due to missing atributes

    ![image](/assets/img/update_anomaly.png)

    Unable to insert a student who has signed up but not enrolled in any courses


- ## Deletion Anomaly
    > Deletion of record(s) causes unintentional loss of data

    ![image](/assets/img/update_anomaly.png)

    If we delete Student `230`, what happens to the data on `Cleaning Data in R`?
