In linux, a link is a connection between a file name and the actual data on the disk. We can also call it a shortcut. There are two types of links:- Soft Link and Hard Link

## Soft Link
Links will be removed if original file is removed or deleted.
> Syntax: ln -s

## Hard Link
Renaming, deleting or removing the file will not affect the link
> Syntx: ln
