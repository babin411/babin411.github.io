- ## Examining Totals with Counts
    ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Incidents
    ```
    > The above sql statments returns the total number of rows in the Incidents table.
    {: .prompt-info}

- ## Count with DISTINCT 
    ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) AS Countries
        FROM Incidents
    ```
    > The above sql statements returns the count for the number of unique country value from the Country field in Incidents table.
    {: .prompt-info}

- ## Count Aggregations
    - `GROUP BY` can be used with `COUNT()` in the same way as the other aggregation functions such as `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
    - Use the `ORDER BY` command to sort the vaues
        - `ASC` will return the smallest values first (default)
        - `DESC` will return the largest values first


- ## COUNT With GROUP BY 
    > Count the rows, subtotaled by Country
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS TotalRowsByCountry, Country
        FROM Incidents
        GROUP BY Country
    ```


- ## COUNT With GROUP BY and ORDER BY
    > Count the rows, subtotaled by Country
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS TotalRowsByCountry, Country
        FROM Incidents
        GROUP BY Country
        ORDER BY Country ASC
    ```


- ## Column totals with SUM
    - `SUM()` provides numeric total of the values in a column
    - It follows the same pattern as other aggregations
    - Combine it with `GROUP BY` to get subtotals based on columns specified


- ## Adding Column Values 
    > Calculate the value subtotaled by Country
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SUM(DurationSeconds) AS TotalDuration, Country
        FROM Incidents
        GROUP BY Country
    ```

# Math with Dates
- ## DATEPART
    - `DATEPART` is used to determine what part of the date you want to calculate. Some of the common abbreviations are:
        - `DD` for Day
        - `MM` for Month
        - `YY` for Year
        - `HH` for Hour

- ## Common data functions in T-SQL are:
    - `DATEADD()`: Add or subtract datetime values
        - Always returns a date
    - `DATEDIFF()`: Obtain the difference between two datetime values
        - Always returns a number


- ## DATEADD
    > To Add or Subtract a value to get a new date use `DATEADD()` <br>
    Syntax: DATEADD(DATEPART, number, date)
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - `DATEPART`: Unit of measurement (DD, MM, etc.)
    - `number`: An integer value to add
    - `date`: A datetime value


- ## Date math with DATEADD
    > What date is 30 days from June 21, 2020?

    ```sql
        SELECT DATEADD(DD, 30, '2020-06-21')
    ```
    > The above sql returns the date '2020-07-21'
    {: .prompt-tip}

    > What date is 30 days before June 21, 2020?

    ```sql
        SELECT DATEADD(DD, -30, '2020-06-21')
    ```
    > The above sql returns the date '2020-05-22'
    {: .prompt-tip}

    
- ## DATEDIFF
    > Returns a date after a number has been added or subtracted to a date<br>
    Syntax: DATEDIFF(datepart, startdate, enddate)
    {: .prompt-info}
    - `datepart`: Unit of measurement (DD,MM,etc.)
    - `startdate`: The starting date value
    - `enddate`: An ending datetime value

    ```sql
        SELECT
            DATEDIFF(DD, '2020-05-22', '2020-06-21') AS Difference1,
            DATEDIFF(DD, '2020-07-21', '2020-06-21') AS Difference2,
    ```
    > The above sql statement referes the difference in day between stardate and enddate provided.
    {: .prompt-info}


- ## Rouding numbers 
    > Syntax: ROUND(number, length [, function])
    {: .prompt-tip}
    ```sql
        SELECT
            DurationSeconds,
            ROUND(DurationSeconds, 0) AS RoundToZero,
            ROUND(DurationSeconds, 1) AS RoundToOne
        FROM Incidents
    ```

- ## Rounding on the left side of the decimal
    ```sql
        SELECT
            DurationSeconds,
            ROUND(DurationSeconds, -1) AS RoundToTen,
            ROUND(DurationSeconds, -2) AS RoundToHundred
        FROM Incidents
    ```

- ## Truncating with ROUND()
    > The `ROUND()` function can be used to truncate values when you specify thethird argument<br>
    Syntax: ROUND(number, length, [, function])
    {: .prompt-tip}
    - Set the third value to anon-zero number

    ```sql
        SELECT
            Profit, 
            ROUND(DurationSeconds,0) AS RoundingtoWhole,
            ROUND(DurationSeconds, 0,1) AS Truncating
        FROM Incidents
    ```

# Math Functions
- ## Absolute Value
    > Syntax: ABS(number) <br>
        - User ABS() to return non-negative values
    {: .prompt-tip}

    ```sql
        SELECT ABS(-2.77), ABS(3), ABS(-2)
    ```

    ```sql
        SELECT
            DurationSeconds,
            ABS(DurationSeconds) AS AbsSeconds
        FROM Incidents
    ```


- ## Squares and Square Roots 
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SQRT(9) AS Sqrt,
            SQUARE(9) AS Square
    ```

- ## Logs
    - `LOG()` returns the natural logarithm
    - Optionally, you can set the base, which if not set is 2.718281828

    > Syntax: LOG(number, [, BASE])
    {: .prompt-tip}

    ```sql
        SELECT
            DurationSeconds,
            LOG(DurationSeconds, 10) AS LogSeconds
        FROM Incidents
    ```


- ## Log of 0
    > You cannot take the log of 0 as it will give you an error
    {: .prompt-danger}

    ```sql
        SELECT LOG(0,10)
    ```
