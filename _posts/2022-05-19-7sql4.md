- ## What is concurrency?
**Concurrency**: two or more transactions that read/change shared data at the same time.
**Isolate our transaction from other transactions**

- ## Transaction isolation levels
    - `READ COMMITTED` **(default)**
    - `READ UNCOMMITTED`
    - `REPEATABLE READ`
    - `SERIALIZABLE`
    - `SNAPSHOT`

    ```
        SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
        {READ UNCOMMITTED | READ COMMITTED | REPEATABLE READ | SERIALIZABLE | SNAPSHOT}
    ```
