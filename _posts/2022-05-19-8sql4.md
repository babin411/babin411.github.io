- ## Data Imputation
    - Divide by zero error when calculating Avg Fare/TripDistance
    - EDA uncovers hundreds of TaxiRide trip records with Trip Distance = 0
    - Data Imputation methods to resolve
        - Mean
        - Hot Deck
        - Omission


- ## Mean Imputation
    - Replace missing value with mean
    - Doesn't change the mean value
    - Increases correlations with other columns

    ```sql
        CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ImputeMean
        AS
        BEGIN
        DECLARE @AvgTripDuration AS float

        SELECT @AvgTripDuration = AVG(Duration)
        FROM CapitalBikeShare
        WHERE Duration > 0

        UPDATE CapitalBikeShare
        SET Duration = @AvgTripDuration
        WHERE Duration = 0
        END;
    ```


- ## Hot Deck Imputation
    - Missing value set to randomly selected value
    - `TABLESAMPLE` clause of `FROM` clause

    ```sql
        CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetDurHotDeck()
        RETURNS decimal(18,4)
        AS BEGIN
        RETURN (SELECT TOP 1 Duration
        FROM CapitalBikeShare
        TABLESAMPLE(1000 rows)
        WHERE Duration > 0)
        END
        SELECT
            StartDate,
            "TripDuration" = CASE WHEN Duration > 0 THEN Duration 
                                    ELSE dbo.GetDurHotDeck() END
        FRom CapitalBikeShare;
    ```

# Case Study of UDFs
- ## Conversion UDFs
    ```sql
        CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ConvertMileToMeter(@miles numeric)
        RETURNS numeric
        AS
        BEGIN
        RETURN (SELECT @miles * 1609.34)
        END


        CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ConvertCurrency(@Currency numeric, @ExchangeRate numeric)
        RETURNS numeric
        AS
        BEGIN
        RETURN (SELECT @ExchangeRate * @Currency)
        END
    ```

# Formatting Tools
- ## Before Formatting
    ```sql
        SELECT
            DATENAME(weekday, StartDate) AS 'DayOfWeek',
            SUM(Duration) AS TotalDuration
        FROM CapitalBikeShare
        GROUP BY DATENAME(weekday, StartDate)
        ORDER BY DATENAME(weekday, StartDate)
    ```

- ## Sort by logical weekday
    ```sql
        SELECT DATENAME(weekday, StartDate) as 'DayOfWeek',
        SUM(Duration) as TotalDuration
        FROM CapitalBikeShare
        GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate)
        ORDER BY
            CASE WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Sunday' THEN 1
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Monday' THEN 2
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Tuesday' THEN 3
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Wednesday' THEN 4
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Thursday' THEN 5
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Friday' THEN 6
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Saturday' THEN 7
        END ASC;
    ```

    ```sql
        SELECT TOP 5
        FORMAT(CAST(StartDate as Date), 'd', 'de-de')
        AS 'German Date',
        FORMAT(CAST(StartDate as Date), 'd', 'en-us')
        AS 'US Eng Date',
        FORMAT(Sum(Duration), 'n', 'de-de')
        AS 'German Duration',
        FORMAT(SUM(Duration), 'n', 'en-us')
        AS 'US Eng Duration',
        FORMAT(SUM(Duration),'#,0.00')
        AS 'Custom Numeric'
        FROM CapitalBikeShare
        GROUP BY CAST(StartDate as Date)
    ```

                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Friday' THEN 6
                WHEN Datename(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Saturday' THEN 7
            END ASC
