- ## Granting and revoking access to a view
    `GRANT privilege(s)` or `REVOKE privilege(s)`<br/>
    `ON object`
    `TO role` or `FROM role`
    - **Privileges:** `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.
    - **Obects:** table, view, schema, etc.
    - **Roles:** a database user or a group of database users

    ```sql
        GRANT UPDATE ON ratings TO PUBLIC;
        REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM db_user;
    ```

-  ## Database Roles
    - Manage database access permissions
    - A database role is a entity that contains information that:
        - Define the role's privileges
            - Can you login?
            - Can you create databases?
            - Can you write to tables?
        - Interact with the client authentication system
            - Password
        - Roles can be assigned to one or more users
        - Roles are global across a database cluster installation


- ## Create a Role
    - Empty Role
        ```sql
            CREATE ROLE data_analyst;
        ```
    - Roles with some attributes set
        ```sql
            CREATE ROLE intern WITH PASSWORD 'PasswordForIntern' VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';

            CREATE ROLE admin CREATEDB;

            ALTER ROLE admin CREATEROLE;
        ```


- ## GRANT and REVOKE privileges from roles
    ```sql
        GRANT UPDATE ON ratings TO data_analyst;

        REVOKE UPDATE ON ratings FROM data_analyst;
    ```
    The available privileges in PostgreSQL are:
    - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `REFERENCES`, `TRIGGER`, `CREATE`, `CONNECT`, `TEMPORARY`, `EXECUTE`, and `USAGE`


- ## Users and groups (are both roles)
    - A role is an entity that can function as a user and/or a group
    - User roles
    - Group roles

    **Group Role**
    ```sql
        CREATE ROLE data_analyst;
    ```

    **User Role**
    ```sql
        CREATE ROLE intern WITH PASSWORD 'PasswordForIntern' VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';

        GRANT data_analyst TO alex;

        REVOKE data_analyst FROM alex;
    ```


- ## Common PostgreSQL roles
    | Role | Allowed Access |
    | pg_read_all_settings | Read all configuration variables, even those normally visible only to superusers. |
    | pg_read_all_stats | Read all pg_stats_* views and use various statistis related extensions, even those normally visible only to superusers. |
    | pg_signal_backend | Send signals to other backendds (eg: cancel query, terminate). |
    | More.. | More .. |


- ## Benefits and pitfalls of roles
    **Benefits**
    - Roles live on after users are deleted
    - Roles can be created before user accounts
    - Save DBAs time
    **Pitfalls**
    - Sometimes a role gives a specific user too much access
        - You need to pay attention

# Table partitioning
- ## Why partition?
    **Problem:** queries / updates become slower
    **Because:** e.g., indices don't fit memory
    **Solution:** split table into smaller parts (=**partitioning**)


- ## Data modeling refresher
    1. **Conceptual Data Model**
    2. **Logical Data Model**
        For partitioning, logical data model is the same
    3. **Physical Data Model**
        Partitioning is part of physical data model

- ## Vertical Partitioning
    ![image](/assets/img/vertical.png)


- ## Horizontal Partitioning
    ![image](/assets/img/horizontal.png)
    
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE sales (
            ...
            timestamp DATE NOT NULL
        )
        PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

        CREATE TABLE sales_2019_q1 PARTITION OF sales
            FOR VALUES FROM ('2019-01-01') TO ('2019-03-31');
        ...
        CREATE TABLE sales_2019_q4 PARTITION OF sales
            FOR VALUES FROM ('2019-09-01') TO ('2019-12-31');
        CREATE INDEX ON sales ('timestamp');
    ```


- ## Pros/Cons of Horizontal Partitioning
    - **Pros**
        - Indices of **heavily-used partitions** fit in memory
        - Move to **specific medium:** slower vs faster
        - Used for both OLAP as OLTp

    - **Cons**
        - Partitioning **existing table** can be a hassle
        - Some **constraints** can not be set


- ## Relation to sharding

# Data Integrations
- ## What is Data Integration?
    > Data Integration combines data from different sources, formats, technologiges to provide users with a translated and unified view of that data.

- ## Choosing a Data Integration Tool
    - Flexible
    - Reliable
    - Scalable

# Picking a Database Management System (DBMS)
-   ## DBMS
    - **DBMS**: DataBase Management System
    - Create and maintain databases
        - Data
        - Database schema
        - Database engine
    - Iterface between database and end users


- ## DBMS types
    - Choice of DBMS depends on database type
    - Two Types:
        - **SQL DMBS**
        - **NoSQL DBMS**

- ## SQL DMBS
    - Relational DataBase Management System (**RDBMS**)
    - Based on the relational model of data
    - Query Language: SQL
    - Best option when:
        - Data is structured and unchanging
        - Data must be consistent
    - Tools: Microsoft-SQL Server, PostgreSQL

- ## NoSQL DBMS
    - Less structured
    - Document-centered rather than table-centered
    - Data doesn't have to fit into well-defined rows and columns
    - Best option when:
        - Rapid growth
        - No clear schema definitions
        - Large quantities of data
    - Types: key-value  store, document store, columnar database, graph database
    


- ## NoSQL DBMS - key-value store
    - Combinations of keys and values
        - Key: unique identifier
        - Value: anything
    - Use case: managing the shopping cart for an on-line buyer
    - Tools: Redis


- ## NoSQL DBMS - document store
    - Similar to key-value
    - Values(=documents) are structured
    - **Use case:** content management
    - Tools: mongoDB


- ## NoSQL DBMS - columnar database
    - Store data in columns
    - Scalable
    - **Use case:** big data analytics where speed is important
    - Tools: Cassandra


- ## NoSQL DMBS - graph database
    - Data is interconnected and best represented as a graph
    - **Use case:** social media data, recommendations
    - Example: neo4j
