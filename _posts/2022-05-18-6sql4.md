# Star and Snowflake Schema
- ## Star Schema
    **Dimensional modeling: star schema**
    **Fact tables**
    - Holds records of a metric
    - Changes regularly
    - Connects to dimensions via foreign keys
    - Example: 
        - Supply books to stores in USA and Canada
        - Keep track of book sales

    **Dimension Tables**
    - Holds descriptions of attributes
    - Does not change as often


- ## Star Schema Example
    - One dimension

- ## Snowflake Schema (an extension)
    - More than one dimension because dimension tables are **normalized**

- ## What is Normalization?
    - Database design technique
    - Divides tables into smalller tables and connects them via relationships
    - **Goal** reduce redundancy and increase data integrity
