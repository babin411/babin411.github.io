- ## Using Variables in T-SQL
    - Variables are needed to set values `DECLARE @variablename data_type`
        - Must start with the character @


- ## Variable data types in T-SQL
    - `VARCHAR(n)`: variable length text field
    - `INT`: integer values from `-2,147,483,647` to `+2,147,483,647`
    - `DECIMAL(p,s)` or `NUMERIC(p,s)`:
        - `p`: total number of decimal digits that will be stored, both to the left and to the right of the decimal point
        - `s`: number of decimal digits that will be stored to the right of the decimal point


- ## Declaring Variables in T-SQL
    > Declare Snack as a VARCHAR with length 10
    ```sql
        DECLARE @Snack VARCHAR(10)
    ```


- ## Assinging values to variables
    > Use SET to set a value to the variable
    ```sql
        SET @Snack = 'Cookies'
    ```
    >  Show the value
    ```sql
        SELECT @Snack
    ```


- ## WHILE Loops
    - `WHILE` evalues a true or false condition
    - After the `WHILE`, there should be a line with the keyword `BEGIN`
    - Next include code to run until the condition in the `WHILE` loop is true
    - After the code add the keyword `END`
    - `BREAK` will cause an exit out of the loop
    - `CONTINUE` will cause the loop to continue

    ```sql
        -- Declare ctr as an integer
        DECLARE @ctr INT
        --Assign 1 to ctr
        SET @ctr = 1
        -- Specify the condition of the WHILE LOOP
        WHILE @ctr < 10
            -- Begin the code to  execute inside the WHILE loop
            BEGIN
                --keep incrementing the value of @ctr
                SET @ctr = @ctr + 1
                --End WHILE loop
            END
        -- VIew the value after the loop
        SELECT @ctr
    ```

    ```sql
        -- Declare ctr as an integer
        DECLARE @ctr INT
        -- Assign 1 to cr
        SET @ctr = 1
        -- Specify the condition of the WHILE LOOP
        WHILE @ctr < 10
            -- Begin the code to execute inside while loop
            BEGIN
                -- Keep incrementing the value of @ctr
                SET @ctr = @ctr + 1

                -- Check if ctr is equal to 4
                IF @ctr  = 4
                    -- When ctr is equal to 4, the loop will break
                    BREAK
                -- End WHILE loop
        END
    ```


- ## Derived Tables
    - Query which is treated like a temporary table
    - Always contained within the main query
    - They are specified in the `FROM` clause
    - Can contain intermediate calculations to be used the main query or different joins than in the main query

    ```sql
        SELECT
            a.* 
        FROM Kidney a
        JOIN (
            SELECT
                AVG(Age) AS AverageAge
            FROM Kidney
        ) b
        ON a.Age = b.AverageAge
    ```


- ## Common Table Expressions (CTE)
    A Common Table Expression (CTE) is the result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query. Much like a derived table, the result of a CTE is not stored and exists only for the duration of the query. This article will focus on non-recurrsive CTEs.
    > Syntax:
    ```sql
        -- CTE definitions start with the keyword WITH
        -- Followed by the CTE names and the columns it contains
        WITH CTEName (Col1, Col2)
        AS
        -- Defint the CTE Query
        (
        -- The two columns from the definition above
            SELECT 
                Col1, 
                Col2
            FROM TableName
        )
    ```
    
    ```sql
        -- Create a CTE to get the Maximum BloodPressure by Age
        WITH BloodPressueAge(Age, MaxBloodPressue)
        AS 
        (
            SELECT
                Age, 
                MAX(BloodPressure) AS MaxBloodPressure
            FROM Kidney
            GROUP BY Age
        )

        -- Create a query to use the CTE as a table
        SELECT
            a.Age,
            MIN(a.BloodPressure),
            b.MaxBloodPressure
        FROM Kidney a
        -- Join the CTE with the table
        JOIN BloodpressureAge b
            ON a.Age = b.Age
        GROUP BY a.Age, b.MaxBloodPressure
    ```
