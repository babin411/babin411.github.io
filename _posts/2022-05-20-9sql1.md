- ## What is a trigger?
    - Special type of stored procedure
    - Executed when an event occurs in the database server
    ![image](/assets/img/triggers.png)


- ## Types of Trigger(based on T-SQL commands)
    - Data Manipulation Language (DML) triggers
        - `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements
    - Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers
        - `CREATE`, `ALTER` or `DROP` statements
    - Logon triggers
        - `LOGON` events


- ## Types of Trigger(based on behavior)
    - `AFTER` trigger
        - The original statment executes
        - Additional statements are triggered
        - Examples of use cases:
            - Rebuild an index after a large insert
            - Notify the admin when data is updated

    - `INSTEAD OF` trigger
        - The original statement is prevented from execution
        - A replacement statement is executed instead
        - Examples of use cases:
            - Prevent insertions
            - Prevent updates
            - Prevent deletions
            - Prevent object modifications
            - Notify the admin


- ## Trigger definition (with AFTER)
    ```sql
        -- Create the trigger by giving it a descriptive name
        CREATE TRIGGER ProductsTrigger
        -- The trigger needs to be attached to a table
        ON Products
        -- The trigger behavior type
        AFTER INSERT
        -- THe beginning of the trigger workflow
        AS
        -- The action executed by the trigger
        PRINT('An insert of data was made in the Products table.');
    ```


- ## Trigger definition(with ISTEAD OF)
    ```sql
        -- Create the trigger by giving it a descriptive name
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventDeleteFromOrders
        -- The trigger needs to be attached on a table
        ON Orders
        -- The trigger behavior type
        INSTEAD OF DELETE
        -- The beginning of the trigger workflow
        AS
        -- The action executed by the trigger
        PRINT('You are not allowed to delete rows from the Orders table.');
    ```


- ## AFTER vs. INSTEAD OF
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER MyFirstAfterTrigger
        ON Table1
        -- Triggered after
        -- the firing event (UPDATE
        AFTER UPDATE
        AS 
        {trigger_actions_section};
    ```

    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER MyFirstInsteadOfTrigger
        ON Table2
        -- Triggered instead of
        -- the firing event (UPDATE)
        INSTEAD OF UPDATE
        AS
        {trigger_actions_section};
    ```

# How DML triggers are used
- ## Why should we use DML triggers?
    - Initiating actions when manipulating data
    - Preventing data manipulation
    - Tracking data or database object changes
    - User auditing and database security


- ## Deciding between AFTER and INSTEAD Of

    | **AFTER trigger** | **INSTEAD OF trigger** |
    | Initial event fires the trigger | Initial event fires the trigger |
    | **Initial event executes** | **Initial event is not executed anymore** |
    | The trigger actions execute | The trigger actions execute |


- ## AFTER trigger usage example
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER SalesNewInfoTrigger
        ON Sales
        AFTER INSERT
        AS
        EXEC sp_cleansing @Tabel = 'Sales';
        EXEC sp_generateSalesReport;
        EXEC sp_sendnotification;
    ```

    - Data is inserted into a sales table
    - Start a data cleansing procedure
    - Generate a table report with the procedure
    - Notify the database administrator


- ## INSTEAD OF trigger usage example
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER BulbsStockTrigger
        ON Bulbs
        INSTEAD OF INSERT
        AS
        IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Bulbs AS b
        INNER JOIN inserted AS i
                    ON b.Brand = i.Brand
                    AND b.Model = i.Model
        WHERE b.Stock = 0)
        BEGIN
            UPDATE b
            SET b.Power = i.Power,
                b.Stock = i.Stock
            FROM Bulbs AS b
            INNER JOIN inserted AS i
                        ON b.Brand = i.Brand
                            AND b.Model = i.Modle
            WHERE b.Stock = 0
        END
        ELSE
            INSERT INTO Bulbs
            SELECT * FROM inserted;
    ```

    - The power changes for some models
    - Update only the products with no stock
    - Add new rows for the products with stock

# Trigger Alternatives
- ## Triggers vs Stored Procedures

    | **Triggers** | **Stored procedures** |
    | Fired automatically by an event | Run only when called explicitly |
    | ```sql INSERT INTO Orders [...];``` | ```sql EXECUTE sp_DailyMaintenance;``` |
    | Don't allow parameters or transactions | Accept input parameters and transactions |
    | Cannot return values as output | Can return values as output |
    | Used for: 1. auditing 2. integrity enforcement | Used for: 1. general tasks 2. user-specific needs |



- ## Triggers vs computed columns

    | **Triggers** | **Computed Columns** |
    | calculate column values | calculate column values |
    | use columns **from other tables** for calculations | use columns **only from the same table** for calculations |
    | `INSERT` or `UPDATE` used to calculate | calculatino defined when creating the table |
    | ```sql [...] UPDATE SET TotalAmount = Price * Quantity [...``` | ```sql [...] TotalAmount AS Price * Quantity [...]```|


- ## Example of a computed column
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE [SalesWithPrice]
        (
            [OrderID] INT IDENTITY(1,1),
            [Customer] NVARCHAR(50),
            [Product] NVARCHAR(50),
            [Price] DECIMAL(10,2),
            [Currency] NVARCHAR(3),
            [Quantity] INT,
            [OrderDate] DATE DEFAULT (GETDATE()),
            [TotalAmount] AS [Quantity] * [Price]
        )
    ```


- ## Using a trigger as a computed column
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER [SalesCalculateTotalAmount]
        ON [SalesWithoutPrice]
        AFTER INSERT
        AS
            UPDATE [sp]
            SET [sp].[TotalAmount] = [sp].[Quantity] * [p].[Price]
            FROM [SalesWithoutPrice] AS [sp]
            INNER JOIN [Products] AS [p] ON [sp].Product = [p].[Product]
            WHERE [sp].[TotalAmount] IS  NULL;
    ```
