In Python, a decorator takes a function and adds some functionality and returns it.  

Everything in python is an objects. In Python, everything is an objectâ€”yes, including classes. Simply said, names defined by us are identifiers attached to these objects. There are no exceptions, functions are also objects (with attributes). The same function object can have multiple names linked to it.
```python
    def first(msg):
        print(msg)

    first('Hello')

    second = first
    second('Hello')

    Output: 
    'Hello'
    'Hello'
```
Both the first and second methods produce the same result when the code is executed. Here, the same function object is referred to by both the first and second names.

Functions can be passed as arguments to another function. Higher order functions are another name for such functions that accept other functions as arguments. Some of the examples of such functions are:- `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

```python
    def inc(x):
        return x + 1

    def dec(x):
        return x - 1

    def operate(func, x):
        result = func(x)
        return result

    print(operate(inc,3))
    Output: 4

    print(operate(dec,3))
    Output: 2
```
Furthermore, a function can return another function.
```python
    def is_callled():
        def is_returned():
            print('Hello')
        return is_returned

    new = is_called()

    new()
    Output: 'Hello'
```
Here, `is_returned()` is a nested function which is defined and returned each time we call `is_called()`.


## Getting back to Decorators
Functions and methods are called callable as they can be called. In actuality, the term "callable" refers to any object that implements the special __call__() method. So a decorator is a callable that returns another callable in the most basic sense. A decorator basically accepts a function, adds some functionality, and then returns it. 
```python
    def make_pretty(func):
        def inner():
            print('I got decorated.')
            func()
        return inner

    def ordinary():
        print('I am ordinary.')

    ordinary()
    Output: 'I am ordinary.'

    #let's decorate this orindary function
    pretty = make_pretty(ordinary)
    pretty()

    Output:
    I got decorated.
    I am ordinary. 
```
In the example shown above, `make_pretty()` is a decorator. 
```python
    pretty = make_pretty(ordinary)
```
The function ordinary() got decorated and the returned function was given the name pretty. 

We can see that the decorator function expanded the original function's capabilities. This is comparable to gift-wrapping.
As a wrapper, the decorator serves. The actual gift inside the adorned object retains its original essence. But now, it appears lovely (since it got decorated).
In most cases, we rename a function and decorate it as, 
```python
    ordinary = make_pretty(ordinary)
```
This is a common construct and for this reason, Python has a syntax to simplify this.

We can use the @ symbol along with the name of the decorator function and place it above the definition of the function to be decorated. For example:
```python
    @make_pretty
    def ordinary():
        print('I am ordinary.')
```
is equivalent to
```python
    def ordinary():
        print('I am ordinary.')
    oridnary = make_pretty(ordinary)
```
This is just a syntactic sugar to implement decorators.


## Decorating Functions With Parameters
The decorator mentioned above was straightforward and merely utilized functions without any parameters.
What if we had functions that accepted the following parameters:
```python
    def divide(a,b):
        return a/b
```
This function has two parameters, `a` and `b`. We know it will give an error if we pass in `b` as `0`.
```python
    divide(2,5)
    Output: 0.4

    divide(2,0)
    Output: 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
Now writing a decorator to check for this case that causes error like:
```python
    def smart_divide(func):
        def inner(a,b):
            print(f'I am going to divide {a} by {b}.')
            if b==0:
                print(f'Whoopsies! cannot divide by zero.')
                return
            return func(a,b)
        return inner
    
    @smart_divide
    def divide(a,b):
        return a/b

    divide(2,5)
    Output:
    'I am going to divide 2 by 5.'
    0.4

    divide(2,0)
    Output:
    'I am going to divide 2 and 5.'
    'Whoopsies! cannot divide by zero.'

```
This new implementation will return None if the error condition arises.

We can decorate functions that take parameters in this way. A careful observer will notice that the parameters of the decorator's nested inner() function match those of the functions it decorates. With this in mind, we can now create universal decorators that function with any quantity of parameters.

In Python, this magic is done as function(*args, **kwargs). In this way, args will be the tuple of positional arguments and kwargs will be the dictionary of keyword arguments. An example of such a decorator will be:
```python
    def works_for_all(func):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            print('I can decorate any function')
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return inner
```


## Chaining Decorators In Python
Python allows for the chaining of several decorators. This means that a function may be decorated more than once by the same or distinct decorators. The decorators are simply positioned above the desired function. 

```python
    def star(func):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            print('*'*30)
            func(*args, **kwargs)
            print('*'*30)
        return inner


    def percent(func):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            print('%'*30)
            func(*args, **kwargs)
            print('%'*30)

    @start
    @percent
    def printer(msg):
        print(msg)

    printer('Hello')

    Output: 
    ******************************
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Hello
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    ******************************
```
The above sytanx of:
```python
    @star
    @percent
    def printer(msg):
        print(msg)
```
is equivalent to
```python
    def printer(msg):
        print(msg)
    printer = star(percent(printer))
```
The order in which we chain decorators matter. If we had reversed the order as,
```python
    @percent
    @star
    def printer(msg):
        print(msg)
```
The output would be:
```python
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    ******************************
    Hello
    ******************************
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```
