- ## Exploring Data With Aggregation
    - Reviewing summarized values for each column is a common first step in analyzing data
    - If the data exists in a database, fastest way to aggregate is to use SQL


- Common Summary Statistics
    - `MIN()` for the minimum value of a column
    - `MAX()` for the maximum value of a column
    - `AVG()` for the mean or average value of a column

    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT
            AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
            MIN(InternetUse) AS MINInternet,
            MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternet
        FROM EconomicIndicators
    ```

- Filtering Summary Data with Where
    > This SQL query filters the aggregated values using a WHERE  caluse
    {: .prompt-info}
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
            MIN(InternetUse) AS MINInternet,
            MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternet
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        WHERE Country = 'Solomon Islands'
    ```

- Subtotaling Aggregations into Groups with GROUP BY
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            Country,
            AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
            MIN(InternetUse) AS MINInternet,
            MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternet
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        GROUP BY Country
    ```


- HAVING is the WHERE for Aggregations
    > Cannot use `WHERE`with `GROUP BY` as it will give error
    > This throws as error
    ```sql
        ...
        GROUP BY
        WHERE MAX(InternetUse) > 100
    ```
    > Instead, use `HAVING`
    > This is how you filter with a GROUP BY
    ```sql    
        GROUP BY
        HAVING MAX(InternetUse) > 100
    ```
    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            Country,
            AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
            MIN(GDP) AS SmallestGDP,
            MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternetUse
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        GROUP BY Country
        HAVING MAX(InternetUse) > 100
    ```

- # Finding and Resolving Missing Data
- ## Detecting Missing Values
    - When you have no data, the empty database field contains the word `NULL`
    - Because `NULL` is not a number, it is not possible to use `=`,`<`,`>` to find or compare missing values
    - To determine if a column contains a `NULL` value, use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`

- ## Returning No NULL Values in T-SQL
    ```sql
        SELECT
            Country,
            InternetUse, 
            Year
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        WHERE InternetUse IS NOT NULL
    ```
    > The above SQL query returns records where the value is InternetUse field is not `NULL`
    {: .prompt-info}


- ## Detecting NULLs in T-SQL
    ```sql
        SELECT
            Country,
            InternetUse, 
            Year
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        WHERE InternetUse IS NULL
    ```
    > The above SQL query returns records where the value is InternetUse field is `NULL`
    {: .prompt-info}


- ## Blank Is Not Null
    - A blank is not the same as a NULL value
    - May show up in columns containing text
    - An empty string `''` can be used to find blank values
    - The best way is to look for a column where the Length or LEN > 0

    ```sql
        SELECT 
            Country, 
            GDP, 
            Year
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        WHERE LEN(GDP) > 0
    ```


- ## Substituting missing data with a specific value using ISNULL
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            GDP, 
            Country,
            ISNULL(Country, 'Unknown') AS NewCountry
        FROM EconomicIndicators
    ```
    > The above SQL query returns a new column called NewCountry which has all the same values as the Country field but the only difference being every NULL value is replaced by `Unknown` keyword.
    {: .prompt-info}


- ## Substituting missing data with a column using ISNULL
    >Substituting values from one column or another with ISNULL
    ```sql
        SELECT
            TradeGDPPercent,
            ImportGoodPercent,
            ISNULL(TradeGDPPercent,ImportGoodPercent) AS NewPercent
        FROM EconomicIndicators
    ```


- ## Substituting NULL values using COALESCE
    > `COALESCE` returns the first non-missing value <br>
    Syntax: COALESCE(value_1, value_2, value_3,....,value_n)
    {: .prompt-info}
    - If `value_1` is `NULL` and `value_2` is not `NULL`, return `value_2`
    - If `value_1` and `value_2` are `NULL` and `value_3` is not `NULL`, return `value_3`

    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT
            TradeGDPPercent, 
            ImportGoodPercent
        COALESCE(TradeGDPPercent, ImportGoodPercent, 'N/A') AS NewPercent
        FROM EconomicIndicators
    ```

- ## Changing column values with CASE
    > 
    Syntax:<br>
        CASE <br>
            WHEN Boolean_expression THEN result_expression [ ...n ]<br>
            [ ELSE else_result_expression ]<br>
        END
    {: .prompt-tip}


- ## Changing column values with CASE IN T-SQL
    ```sql
        SELECT
            Continent
        CASE WHEN Continent = 'Europe' or Continent = 'Asia' THEN 'Eurasia'
            ELSE 'Other'
            END AS NewContinent
        FROM EconomicIndicators
    ```

- ## Using CASE statements to create value groups
    > We are binning the data here into discrete groups
    ```sql
        SELECT
            Country,
            LifeExp,
        CASE WHEN LifeExp < 30 Then 1
            WHEN LifeExp > 29 AND LifeExp < 40 THEN 2
            WHEN LifeExp > 39 AND LifeExp < 50 THEN 3
            WHEN LifeExp > 49 AND LifeExp < 60 THEN 4
            ELSE 5
            END AS LifeExpGroup
        FROM EconomicIndicators
        WHERE Year = 2007
    ```
