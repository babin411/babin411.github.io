- ## Grouping data in T-SQL
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            ModifiedDate
        FROM SaleGoal
        WHERE SalesYear = 2011
    ```

- ## Window syntax in T-SQL
    - Create the window with `OVER`  caluse
    - `PARTITION BY` creates the frame
    - If you do not include `PARTITION BY` the frame is the entire table
    - To arrange the results, use `ORDER BY`
    - Allows aggregations to be created at the same time as the window

    ```sql
        -- Create a Window Data Grouping
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY SalesYear)
    ```

- ## Window Functions (SUM)
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson, 
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            SUM(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear) AS YearlyTotal,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```


- ## Window Functions (COUNT)
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            COUNT(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear) AS QuotaPerYear,
            ModifiedDate as ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal 
    ```

# Common Window Functions
- ## FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE()
    - `FIRST_VALUE()` returns the first value in the window
    - `LAST_VALUE()` returns the last value in the window
    > Note that for `FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE` the `ORDER BY` command is required
        {: .prompt-tip}

    ```sql
        -- Select the columns
        SELECT 
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            -- First value from every window
            FIRST_VALUE(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS StartQuota,
            -- Last value from every window
            LAST_VALUE(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS
            EndQuota,
            ModifiedDate as ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

- ## Gettting the next value with LEAD()
    - Provides the ability to query the value from the next row
    - NextQuota Column is created by using `LEAD()`
    - Requires the use of `ORDER BY` to order the rows

    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
        -- Create a window function to get the values from the next row
            LEAD(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS NextQuota,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

- ## Getting the previous value with LAG()
    - Provides the ability to query the value from the previous row
    - PreviousQuota Column is created by using `LAG()`
    - Requires the use of `ORDER BY` to order the rows

    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
        -- Create a window function to get the values from the previous row
            LAG(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS PreviousQuota,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

# Increasing Window Complexity
- ## Reviewing Aggregations
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson, 
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            SUM(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear) AS YearlyTotal,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```


- ## Adding ORDER BY to an aggregation
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            SUM(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY SalesPerson) AS YearlyTotal,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```


- ## Creating a running total with ORDER BY
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            SUM(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS RunningTotal,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

- ## Adding row numbers
    - `ROW_NUMBER()`sequentially numbers the rows in the window
    - `ORDER BY` is required when using `ROW_NUMBER()`

    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            ROW_NUMBER()
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesPerson ORDER BY SalesYear) AS QuotabySalesPerson
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

# Using Windows For Calculating Statistics
- ## Calculating the Standard Deviation
    - Calculate standard deviation either for the entire table or for each window
    - `STDEV()` calculates the standard deviation

    > Calculating the standard deviation for the entire table
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYear,
            CurrentQuota,
            STDEV(CurrentQuota)
            OVER() AS StandardDev,
            ModifiedDate as ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

    > Calculating the standard deviation for each partition
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            SalesPerson,
            SalesYeaer,
            CurrentQuota,
            STDEV(CurrentQuota)
            OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY SalesYear) AS StDev,
            ModifiedDate AS ModDate
        FROM SaleGoal
    ```

- ## Calculating the Mode
    - Mode is the value which appears the most often in your data
    - To calculate mode:
        - Create a CTE containing an ordered count of values using ROW_NUMBER
        - Write a query using the CTE to pick the value with the highest row number

    ```sql
        WITH QuotaCount AS (
            SELECT
                SalesPerson,
                SalesYear,
                CurrentQuota,
                ROW_NUMBER()
                OVER (PARTITION BY CurrentQuota ORDER BY CurrentQuota) AS QuotaList
            FROM SaleGoal
        )
        
        SELECT 
            CurrentQuota, 
            QuotaList AS Mode
        FROM QuotaCount
        WHERE QuotaList In (SELECT MAX(QuotaList) FROM QuotaCount)
    ```
