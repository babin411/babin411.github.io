## How to chagne permissions?
To change the permissions in the file or directory we use the `chmod` command.

```
    Syntax:
        chmod u+r <file_name> (For adding reading permission to the current user)
        chmid u-r <file_name> (For removing reading permission from the current user)

        chmod ugo+r <file_name> (For adding reading permisison to the current_user, group and others)
        chmod ugo+r <file_name> (For removing reading permisison from the current_user, group and others)

        chmod a+rwx <file_name> (adding permission for all)
```

**Note**: One user cannot change the permission of the files and directories of another user unless it's the `root` user.
