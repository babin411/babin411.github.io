- ## What is a Key?
    - Attribute(s) that idenfity a record uniquely
    - As long as attributes can be removed: **superkey**
    - If no more attributes can be removed: minimal superky or **key**


- ## Primary Keys
    - One  primary key per database table, chosen from candidate keys
    - Uniquely identifies records, e.g for referencing in other tables
    - Unique and not-null constraints both apply
    - Primary keys are time-invariant

    Example: 
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE products(
            product_no integer UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            name text,
            price numeric
        );
        
        CREATE TABLE products(
            product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
            name text,
            price numeric
        );
        
        CREATE TABLE example(
            a integer,
            b integer,
            c integer,
            PRIMARY KEY (a,c)
        );
    ```

    Specifying Primary Keys
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        ADD CONSTRAINT some_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name)
    ```

- ## Surrogate Keys (a.k.a Synthetic Primary Key)
    - Surrogate Keys also called as a *Synthetic Primary Key* are the artifically created keys in order to  uniquely identify a row in the table when there are no natural primay key in the table.
    - Primary Keys should be built from as few columns as possible
    - Primary Keys should never change over time

    Adding a surrogate key with serial data type
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE cars
        ADD COLUMN id serial PRIMARY KEY;

        INSERT INTO cars
        VALUES ('Volkswagen', 'Blitz', 'black');
    ```

    Another type of surrogate key
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        ADD COLUMN column_c varchar(256);

        UPDATE table_name
        SET column_c = CONCAT(column_a, column_b);
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        ADD CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (column_c);
    ```
