The software utility `cron` also known as `cron job` is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer  operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs to run periodicallly at fixed times, day, dates, or intervals. 

## crontab command
The crontab command is used to schedule commands to be executed periodically. Crontab uses a daemon, crond, which keeps running in background and checks once a minute to see if any of the scheduled jobs need to be executed. 

- `crontab -l`: To show all the current jobs
- `crontab -e`: TO edit or add new jobs
