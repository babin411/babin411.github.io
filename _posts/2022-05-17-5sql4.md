- ## COUNT()
    > Returns the number of items found in a group.
    {: .prompt-info}

    ```sql
        COUNT([ALL] expression)
        COUNT(DISTINCT expression)
        COUNT(*)
    ```

    Example: 
    ```sql
        SELECT
            COUNT(ALL country) AS count_countries_all,
            COUNT(country) AS count_countries,
            COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS distinct_countries,
            COUNT(*) AS all_voters
        FROM voters;
    ```


- ## SUM()
    > Return the sum of all values from a group
    {: .prompt-info}

    ```sql
        SUM([ALL] expression)
        SUM(DISTINCT expression)
    ```
    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SUM(ALL_total_votes) AS tot_votes1,
            SUM(total_votes) AS tot_votes2,
            SUM(DISTINCT total_votes) AS dist
        FROM voters
        WHERE total_votes = 153;
    ```


- ## MAX() and MIN()
    > Syntax:<br/>
    MAX([ALL] expression)<br/>
    MAX(DISTINCT expression)
    {: .prompt-tip}

    > Returns the maximum value in the expression
    
    > Syntax:<br/>
    MIN([ALL] expression)<br/>
    MIN(DISTINCT expression)
    {: .prompt-tip}

    > Returns the minimum value in the expression

    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT
            MIN(rating) AS min_rating,
            MAX(rating) AS max_rating
        FROM ratings;
    ```


- ## AVG()
    > Returns the average of the values in the group.

    > Syntax: <br/>
    AVG([ALL] expression)<br/>
    AVG(DISTINCT expression)

    ```sql
        SELECT
            AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
            AVG(DISTINCT rating) AS avg_dist
        FROM ratings;
    ```


- ## Grouping Data
    ```sql
        SELECT
            company,
            AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
        FROM ratings
        GROUP BY company;
    ```

# Analytic Functions
- ## FIRST_VALUE()
    > Syntax: <br/>
    FIRST_VALUE(numeric_expression)<br/>
        OVER([PARTITION BY column] ORDER BY column ROW_or_RANGE frame)
    {: .prompt-tip}

    > Returns the first  value in an ordered set.
    `OVER` clause components

    | **Component** | **Status** | **Description** |
    | PARTITION by column | optional | divide the result set into partitions |
    | ORDER BY column | mandatory | order the result set |
    | ROW_or_RANGE frame | optional | set the partition limits |


- ## LAST_VALUE()
    > Syntax: <br/>
    LAST_VALUE(numeric_expression)<br/>
        OVER([PARTITION BY column] ORDER BY column ROW_or_RANGE frame)
    {: .prompt-tip}

    > Returns the last value in an ordered set.


- ## Partition Limits
    `RANGE BETWEEN start_boundary AND end_boundary` <br/>
    `ROWS BETWEEN start_boundary AND end_boundary` <br/>

    | **Boundary** | **Description** |
    | UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | first row in the partition |
    | UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING | last row in the partition |
    | CURRENT ROW | current row |
    | PRECEDING | previous row |
    | FOLLOWING | next row |

    Example: 
    ```sql
        SELECT
            first_name + ' ' + last_name AS name,
            gender, 
            total_votes AS votes,
            FIRST_VALUE(total_votes)
            OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY total_votes) AS min_votes,
            LAST_VALUE(total_votes)
            OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY total_votes
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS max_votes
        FROM voters;
    ```


- ## LAG() AND LEAD()
    `LAG(numeric_expression) OVER ([PARTITION BY column] ORDER BY column)`
    > Accesses date from a previous row in the same result set.

    `LEAD(numeric_expression) OVER ([PARTITION BY column] ORDER BY column)`
    
    > Accesses data from a subsequent row in the sam result set.

    ```sql
        SELECT
            broad_bean_origin AS bean_origin,
            rating,
            cocoa_percent,
            LAG(cocoa_percent) OVER (ORDER BY rating) AS percen_lower_rating,
            LEAD(cocoa_percent) OVER (ORDER BY rating) AS percent_higher_rating
        FROM ratings
        WHERE company = 'Felchlin'
        ORDER BY rating ASC;
    ```

# Mathematical Functions
- ## ABS(numeric_expresison)
    - Returns the absolute value of an expression.
    - Is the non-negative value of the expression.

    ```sql
        SELECT
            ABS(-50.4 * 3) AS negative,
            ABS(0.0) AS zero,
            ABS(73.2 + 15 + 8.4) AS positive;
    ```

- ## SIGN(numeric_expression)
    > Returns the sign of an expression, as an integer:
    - -1(negative numbers)
    - 0
    - +1(positive numbers)

    ```sql
        SELECT
            SIGN(-50.4*3) AS negative,
            SIGN(0.0) AS zero,
            SIGN(73.2 + 15 + 8.4) AS positive;
    ```


- ## Rounding Functions
    - `CEILING(numeric_expression)`
        - Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the expression.
    - `FLOOR(numeric_expression)`
        - Returns the largest integer less tha or equal to the expressino
    - `ROUND(numeric_expression, length)`
        - Returns a numeric value, rounded to the specified length.

    Example:
    ```sql
        SELECT
            CEILING(-50.39) AS ceiling_neg, -- -50
            CEILING(73.71) AS ceiling_pos; -- 74
    ```

    ```sql
        SELECT
            CEILING(-50.49) AS ceiling_neg, -- 50
            FLOOR (-50.49) AS floor_neg, -- -51
            CEILING(73.71) AS ceiling_pos, -- 74
            FLOOR(73.71) AS floor_ps -- 73
            ROUND(-50.493,1) AS round_neg, -- -50.00
            ROUND(73.715, 2) AS round_pos;
    ```

- ## Exponential functions
    - `POWER(numeric_expression, power)
        - Returns the expression raised to the specified power.
    - `SQUARE(numeric_expression)`
        - Returns the square of the expression.
    - `SQRT(numeric_expression)`
        - Returns the square root of the expression.
    - **Keep in mind:** the type of the expression is **float** or can be implicitely converted to **float**.


- ## POWER() example
    ```sql
        SELECT
            POWER(2,10) AS pos_num,
            POWER(-2,10) AS neg_num_even_pow,
            POWER(-2,11) AS neg_num_odd_power,
            POWER(2.5,2) AS float_num,
            POWER(2, 2.72) AS float_pow;
    ```


- ## SQUARE() example
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SQUARE(2) AS pos_num,
            SQUARE(-2) AS neg_num,
            SQUARE(2.5) AS float_num;
    ```


- ## SQRT() example
    ```sql
        SELECT
            SQRT(2) AS int_num,
            SQRT(2.76)  AS float_num;
    ```
