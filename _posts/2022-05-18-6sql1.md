- ## How should we organize and manage data?
    - **Schemas**: How should my data be logically organized?
    - **Normalization**: Should my data have minimal dependency and redundancy?
    - **Views**: What joins will be done most ofte?
    - **Access Control**: Should all users  of the data have the same level of access
    - **DBMS**: How do I pick between all the SQL and noSQL options?
    

- ## Approaches to processing data
    
    | **<center>OLTP</center>** | **<center>OLAP</center>**| 
    | **O**nline **T**ransaction **P**rocessing | **O**nline **A**nalytical **P**rocessing |
    | - Find the price of a book | - Calculate books with best profit margin | 
    | - Update latest customer transaction | - Find most loyal customers |
    | - Keep track of employee hours | - Decide employee of the month |


- ## OLVAP vs OLTP 

    |   | **OLTP** | **OLAP** |
    | Purpose | support daily transactions | report and analyze data |
    | Data | up-to-date, operational | consolidated, historical |
    | Size | snapshot, gigabyters | archive, terrabytes |
    | Queries | simple transactions & frequent updates | complex, aggregate queries & limited updates |
    | Users | thousands | hundreds |

# Storing Data
- ## Structuring Data
    1. Structured data
        - Follows a schema
        - Defined data types & relationships
        - E.g:- SQL, tables in a relational database

    2. Unstuctured Data
        - Schemaless
        - Makes up most of data in the world
        - E.g: - Photos, chat logs, MP3

    3. Semi-structued data
        - Does not follow larger schema
        - Self-describing structure
        - E.g: - NoSQL, XML, JSON

        ```
            # Example of a JSON file
            'user': {
                'profile_use_background_image': true,
                'statuses_count': 31,
                'profile_background_color': 'CODEED',
                'followers_count': 3066,
                ...
            }
        ```


- ## Storing data beyond traditional databases
    - **Traditional databases**
        - For storing real-time relational structured data? **OLTP**
    - **Data warehouses**
        - For analyzing achieved structured data? **OLAP**
    - **Data lakes**
        - For storing data of all structures = flexibility and scalability
        - For analyzing **big data**


- ## Data Warehouses
    - Optimized for analytics - **OLAP**
        - Organized for reading/aggregating data
        - Usually read-only
    - Contains data from multiple sources
    - Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
    - Typically uses a denormalized schema and dimensional modeling

    <b>Data Marts</b>
    - Subset of data warehouses
    - Dedicated to a specific topic

- ## Data Lakes
    - Store **all** types of data at **a lower cost**
        - E.g:- raw, operational databases, IoT device logs, real-time, relational and non-relational
        - Retains all data  and can take up petabytes
        - Schema-on-read as opposed to schema-on-write
        - Need to catalog data otherwise becomes a **data swamp**
        - Run **big data analytics** using services such as **Apache Spark** and **Hadoop**
            - Useful for deep learning and data discovery because activites requires so much data

# Database Design

- ## What is database design?
    - Determines how data is logically stored
        - How is data going to be read and updated?
    - Uses *database models**: high-level specifications for database structure
        - Most popular: relational model
        - Some other options: NoSQL models, object-oriented model, network model
    - Use **schemas**: blueprint of the database
        - Defines tables, fields, relationships, indexes, and views
        - When inserting data in relational databases, schemas must be respected


- ## Data Modeling
    > Process of creating a data model for the data to be stored.
    1. **Conceptual data model**: describes entities, relationships, and attributes
        - Tools: data structure diagrams, e.g:- entity-relational diagrams and UML diagrams
    2. **Logical data modle**: defines tables, columns, relationships
        - Tools: database models and schemas, e.g:- relational model and star schema
    3. **Physical data model**: describes physical storage
        - Tools: partitions, CPUs, indexes, backup systems and tablespaces

- ## Beyond the relational model-Dimensional Modeling
    Adaptation of the relational model for data warehouse design
    - Optimized for  **OLAP** queries: aggregate data, not updating (OLTP)
    - Built using the star schema
    - Easy to interpret and extend schema
    
- ## Element of dimensional modeling
    ![image](/assets/img/star.png)
    **Organize by:**
    - What is being analyzed?
    - How often do entities change?

    **Fact tables**
    - Decided by business use-case
    - Holds records of a metric
    - Changes regularly
    - Connects to dimensions via foreign keys

    **Dimension tables**
    - Holds descriptions of attributes
    - DOes not change as often
