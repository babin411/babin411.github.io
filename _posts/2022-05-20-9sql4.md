- ## Deleting Table and View Triggers
    ```sql
        DROP TRIGGER PreventNewDiscounts;
    ```

- ## Deleting Database Triggers
    ```sql
        DROP TRIGGER PreventNewDiscounts;

        DROP TRIGGER PreventViewsModifications
        ON DATABASE:
    ```

- ## Deleting Server Triggers
    ```sql
        DROP TRIGGER PreventNewDiscounts;

        DROP TRIGGER PreventViewsModifications ON DATABASE:

        DROP TRIGGER DisallowLinkedServers ON ALL SERVER;
    ```


- ## Disabling Triggers
    ```
        DISABLE TRIGGER PreventNewDiscounts
        ON Discounts;

        DISABLE TRIGGER PreventViewsModifications
        ON DATABASE;

        DISABLE TRIGGER DisallowLinkedServers
        ON ALL SERVER;
    ```


- ## Enabling Triggers
    ```
        ENABLE TRIGGER PreventNewDiscounts
        ON Discounts;

        ENABLE TRIGGER PreventViewsModifications
        ON DATABASE;

        ENABLE TRIGGER DisallowLinkedServers
        ON ALL SERVER;
    ```

- ## Alterign Triggers
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventDiscountsDelete
        ON Discounts
        INSTEAD OF DELETE
        AS  
            PRINT 'You are not allowed to data from the Discounts table.';

        DROP TRIGGER PrevetnDiscountsDelete;
        

        CREATE TRIGGER PreventDiscountsDelete
        ON Discounts
        INSTEAD OF DELETE
        AS
            PRINT "You are note allowed to remove data from the Discounts table."

        ALTER TRIGGER PreventDiscountsDelete
        ON Discounts
        INSTEAD OF DELETE
        AS 
            PRINT "You are not allowed to remove data from the Discounts table.';
    ```

# Trigger Management
- ## Getting info from sys.triggers
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.triggers;
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/trigger.png)

    | `name` | trigger name |
    | `object_id` | unique identifier of the trigger | 
    | `parent_class` | trigger type as integer |
    | `parent_class_desc` | trigger type as text |
    | `parent_id` | unique identifier of the parent object |
    | `create_date` | date of creation |
    | `modify_date` | date of last modification |
    | `is_disabled` | current state |
    | `is_instead_of_trigger` | `INSTEAD OF` or `AFTER` trigger |


- ## Getting info from sys.server_triggers
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.server_triggers;
    ```

- ## Getting info from sys.trigger_events
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.trigger_events;
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/sys_triggers.png)

    | `object_id` | unique identifier of the trigger | 
    | `type` | event type as integer |
    | `type_desc` | event type as text |
    | `event_group_type` | event group type as integer |
    | `event_group_type_desc` | event group type as text |


- ## Getting info from sys.server_trigger_events
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.server_trigger_events;
    ```

# Troubleshooting triggers
- ## Tracking Trigger Executinos (system view)
    ```sql
        SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_trigger_stats;
    ```

- ## Tracking Trigger Executions (custom solution)
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventOrdersUpdate
        ON Orders
        INSTEAD OF UPDATE
        AS 
            RAISERROR('Updates on "Orders" table are not permitted. Place a new order to add new products.', 16, 1);
    ```


- ## Identifying triggers attached to a table
    ```sql
        SELECT name AS TableName,
                object_id AS TableId
        FROM sys.objects
        WHERE name = "Products";
    ```

    ```sql
        SELECT o.name AS TableName,
            o.object_id AS TableID,
            t.name AS TriggerName,
            t.object_id AS TriggerID,
            t.is_disabled AS IsDisabled,
            t.is_instead_of_trigger AS IsInsteadOf
        FROM sys.objects AS o
        INNER JOIN sys.triggers AS t ON t.parent_id = o.object_id
        WHERE o.name = 'Products';
    ```

- ## Identifying events capable of firing a trigger
    ```sql
            SELECT o.name AS TableName,
                o.object_id AS TableID,
                t.name AS TriggerName,
                t.object_id AS TriggerID,
                t.is_disabled AS IsDisabled,
                t.is_instead_of_trigger AS IsInsteadOf,
                te.type_desc AS FiringEvent
            FROM sys.objects AS o
            INNER JOIN sys.triggers AS t ON t.parent_id = o.object_id
            INNER JOIN sys.trigger_events AS te ON t.object_id = te.object_id
            WHERE o.name = 'Products';
    ```

- ## Viewing the trigger definitions
    ```sql
        SELECT o.name AS TableName,
            o.object_id AS TableID,
            t.name AS TriggerName,
            t.object_id AS TriggerID,
            t.is_disabled AS IsDisabled,
            t.is_instead_of_trigger AS IsInsteadOf,
            te.type_desc AS FiringEvent,
            OBJECT_DEFINITION(t.object_id) AS TriggerDefinition
        FROM sys.objects AS o
        INNER JOIN sys.triggers AS t ON t.parent_id = o.object_id
        INNER JOIN sys.trigger_events AS te ON t.object_id = te.object_id
        WHERE o.name = 'Products';
    ```
