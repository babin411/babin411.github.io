- ## Implementing relationships with Foreign Keys
    - A Foreign Key (FK) points to the Primary key (PK) of another table.
    - Domain of FK must be equal to the domain of PK
    - Each value of FK must exist in PK of the other table (FK constraint or 'REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY)
    - FKs are not actual keys.

- ## Specifying Foreign Keys
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE manufacturers(
            name varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY
        );

        INSERT INTO manufacturers
        VALUES ('Ford'),('VW'), ('GM');

        CREATE TABLE cars(
            model varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY,
            manufacturer_name varchar(255) REFERENCES manufacturers (name)
        );

        INSERT INTO cars
        VALUES ('Ranger', 'Ford'), ('Beetle', 'VW');
    ```

- ## Specifying Foreign Keys to Existing Tables
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE a
        ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);
    ```


- ## How to Implement N:M-relationships
    - Create a table
    - Add foreign keys for every connected table
    - Add additional attributes
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE affiliations (
            professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id),
            organization_id varchar(256) REFERENCES organizations (id),
            functino varchar(256)
        );
    ```
    - No primary key


- ## Referential Integrity
    - A record referencing another table must refer to an existing record in that table.
    - Specified between two tables
    - Enforced through foreign keys


- ## Referential Integrity Violations
    Referential Integrity from table A to table B is violated....
    - ... if a record in table B that is referenced from a record in table A i deleted.
    - ... if a record in table A referencing a non-existing record from table B is inserted.
    - Foreing keys prevent violations!


- ## Dealing with violations
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE a (
            id integer PRIMARY KEY,
            column_a varchar(64),
            ...,
            b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
        );

        CREATE TABLE a (
            id integer PRIMARY KEY,
            column_a varchar(64),
            ...,
            b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
        );
    ```
    ON DELETE...
    - `NO ACTION`: Throw an error
    - `CASCADE`: Delete all referencing records
    - `RESTRICT`: Throw an error
    - `SET NULL`: Set the referencing column to NULL
    - `SET DEFAULT`: Set the referencing column to its default value
