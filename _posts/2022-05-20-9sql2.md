- ## Definition and properties
    - Performs a set of actions when fired
    - The actions are performed only after the DML event is finisehd
    - Used with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements for tables or views

- ## AFTER trigger prerequisites
    - Table or view needed  for DML statements
    - The trigger will be attached to the same table
    Output from table `Products` used for this example:
    ![image](/assets/img/product.png)


- ## AFTER trigger definition
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER TrackRetiredProducts
        ON Products
        AFTER DELETE
        AS
            INSERT INTO RetiredProducts (Product, Measure)
            SELECT Product, Measure
            FROM deleted;
    ```


- ## "inserted" and "deleted" tables
    - Special Tables are used by DML triggers
    - Created automatically by SQL Server

    | **Special Table** | **INSERT** | **UPDATE** | **DELETE** |
    | inserted | new rows | new rows | N/A |
    | deleted | N/A | updated rows | removed rows |


- ## The complete AFTER trigger
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER TrackRetiredProducts
        ON Products
        AFTER DELETE
        AS 
            INSERT INTO RetiredProducts (Product, Measure)
            SELECT Product, Measure
            FROM deleted;
    ```


<hr/>

# INSTEAD OF triggers(DML)
- ## Definition and Properties
    - Performs a set of actions when fired
    - The actions are performed instead of the DML event
    - The DML event does not run anymore
    - Used with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements for table or views


- ## INSTEAD OF trigger definition
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventOrdersUpdate
        ON Orders
        INSTEAD OF UPDATE
        AS  
            RAISERROR('Updates on "Orders" table are not permitted. Plae a new order to add new products', 16, 1);
    ```

<hr/>

# DDL Triggers
- ## Definition and Properties
    | **DML triggers** | **DDL triggers** |
    | events associated with DML statements `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` | events associated with DDL statements `CREATE, ALTER, DROP` |
    | used with `AFTER` or `INSTEAD OF ` | only used with `AFTER` |
    | attached to tables or views | attached to database or servers | 
    | `inserted` and `deleted` special tables | no special tables |


- ## DDl trigger definition
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER TrackTableChanges
        ON DATABASE
        FOR CREATE_TABLE,
            ALTER_TABLE,
            DROP_TABLE
        AS 
            INSERT INTO TablesChangeLog(EventData, ChangedBy)
            VALUES (EVENTDATA(), USER);
    ```

- ## Preventing the triggering events for DML triggers
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER PreventTableDeletion
        ON DATABASE
        FOR DROP_TABLE
        AS 
            RAISERROR('You are not allowed to remove tables from this database.', 16, 1);
            ROLLBACK:
    ```

# Logon Triggers
- ## Definition and Properties
    - Performs a set of actions when fired
    - The actions are performed for `LOGON` events
    - After authentication phase, but before the session establishment

- ## Logon trigger definition
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER LogonAUdit
        ON ALL SERVER WITH EXECUTE AS 'sa'
        FOR LOGON
        AS 
            INSERT INTO ServerLogonLog
                (LoginName, LoginDate, SessionId, SourceIPAddress)
            SELECT ORIGINAL_LOGIN(), GETDATE(), @@SPID, client_net_address
            FROM SYS.DM_EXEC_CONNECTIONS WHERE  session_id = @@SPID;
    ```

- ## Logon trigger definition summary
    ```sql
        CREATE TRIGGER LogonAudit
        ON ALL SERVER WITH EXECUTE AS 'sa'
        FOR LOGON
        AS 
            INSERT INTO ServerLogonLog
                (LoginName, LoginDate, SessionID, SourceIPAddress)
            SELECT ORIGINAL_LOGIN(), GETDATE(), @@SPID, client_net_address
            FROM SYS.DM_EXEC_CONNECTIONS WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
    ```
