# Using Aggregation Functions Over Windows

- ## Ranking Functions
    - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Unique, ascending integer value starting from 1.
    - `RANK()`: Ascending integer value starting from 1. Can have ties. Can skip numbers.
    - `DENSE_RANK()`: Ascending integer value starting from 1. Can have ties. Will not skip numbers. 


- ## Calculating Row Numbers
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.RunsScored,
            ROW_NUMBER()
            OVER (ORDER BY s.RunsScored DESC) AS rn
        FROM dbo.Scores s
        ORDER BY 
            s.RunsScored DESC;
    ```

- ## Calculating ranks and dense ranks
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.Runscored,
            RANK() 
            OVER (ORDER BY s.RunsScored DESC) AS rk,
            DENSE_RANK()
            OVER (ORDER BY s.RunsScored DESC) AS dr
        FROM dbo.Scores s
        ORDER BY 
            s.RunsScored DESC;
    ```


- ## Partitions
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            s.Team,
            s.RunsScored,
            ROW_NUMBER()
            OVEr (PARTITION BY s.Team ORDER BY s.RunsScored DESC) AS rn
        FROM dbo.Scores s
        ORDER BY
            s.RunsScored DESC:
    ```

- ## Alaises for Multiple Window Functions
    ```sql
        SELECT 
            id,
            account_id,
            standard_qty,
            DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS dense_rank,
            SUM(standard_qty) OVER main_window AS sum_standard_qty,
            COUNT(standard_qty) OVER main_window AS count_standard_qty,
            AVG(standard_qty) OVER main_window AS avg_standard_qty,
            MIN(standard_qty) OVER main_window AS min_standard_qty,
            MAX(standard_qty) OVER main_window AS max_standard_qty
        FROM demo.orders
        WINDOW main_window AS (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at))
    ```


- ## Aggregate Functions
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.Team,
            s.RunsScored,
            MAX(s.RunsScored)
            OVER (PARTITION BY s.Team) AS MaxRuns
        FROM dbo.Scores s
        ORDER By
            s.RunsScored DESC;
    ```


- ## Aggregations with Empty Windows
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.Team,
            s.RunsScored,
            MAX(s.RunsScored)
            OVER() AS MaxRuns
        FROM dbo.Scores s
        ORDER BY
            s.RunsScored DESC;
    ```

# Calculating Running Totals and Moving Averages

- ## Running Totals
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.Team,
            s.Game,
            s.RunsScored,
            SUM(s.RunsScored)
            OVER(PARTITION BY s.Team ORDER BY s.Game ASC
            RANGE BETWEEN
                UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
                AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS TotalRuns
        FROM #Scores s;
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/running_totals.png)

- ## RANGE and ROWS
    - `RANGE`
        - Specify a range of results
        - "Duplicates" processed all at once
        - Only supports `UNBOUNDED` and `CURRENT ROW`
    
    - `ROWS`
        - Specify number of rows to include
        - "Duplicates" processed a row at a time
        - Supports `UNBOUNDED`, `CURRENT ROW`, and number of rows


- # Calculating Moving Averages
    ```sql
        SELECT
            s.Team,
            s.Game,
            s.RunsScored,
            AVG(s.RunsScored)
            OVER (PARTITION BY s.Team ORDER BY s.Game ASC
                ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS AvgRuns
        From #Scores s;
    ```

# Working with LAG() and LEAD()

- ## The LAG() window function
    ```sql
        SELECT
            dsr.CustomerId,
            dsr.MonthStartDate,
            LAG(dsr.NumberOfVisits)
            OVER(PARTITION BY dsr.CustomerID ORDER BY dsr.MonthStartDate) AS Prior,
            dsr.NumberOfVisits
        FROM dbo.DaySpaRollup dsr;
    ```


- ## The LEAD() Window Function
    ```sql
        SELECT
            dsr.CustomerId,
            dsr.MonthStartDate,
            dsr.NumberOfVisits,
            LEAD(dsr.NumberOfVisits)
            OVER (PARTITION BY dsr.CustomerID ORDER BY dsr.MonthStartDate) AS Next
        FROM dbo.DaySpaRollup dsr;
    ```


- ## Specifying number of rows back
    ```sql
        SELECT
            dsr.CustomerId,
            dsr.MonthStartDate,
            LAG(dsr.NumberOfVisits, 2) 
            OVER (PARTITION BY dsr.CustomerID ORDER BY dsr.MonthStartDate) AS Prior2,
            LAG(dsr.NumberOfVisits,1) 
            OVER (PARTITION BY dsr.CustomerID ORDER BY dsr.MonthStartDate) AS Prior1,
            dsr.NumberOfVisits
        FROM dbo.DaySpaRollup dsr;
    ```

    ```sql
        SELECT
            Date,
            LAG(Val,1) OVER (ORDER BY DATE) AS PriorVal,
            Val
        FROM t;
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/lag.png)

    ```sql
        SELECT
            Date,
            LAG(Val,1) OVER (ORDER BY DATE) As PriorVal,
            Val
        FROM t
        WHERE 
            t.Dat > '2019-01-02';
    ```
    ![image](/assets/img/lag2.png)


- ## Windows and filters and CTEs
    ```sql
        WITH records AS (
            SELECT
                Date,
                LAG(Val,1) 
                OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS PriorVal,
                VAL
            FROM t
        )
        SELECT
            r.Date,
            r.PriorVal,
            r.Val
        FROM records r
        WHERE
            r.Date > '2019-01-02';
    ```
